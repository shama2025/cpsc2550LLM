going to ask you.\", \"So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what\\'s going on?Okay.\", \"No, I totally understand that.\", \"I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through.\", \"And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I\\'m glad that you\\'ve asked it.\", \"Talk to me about this.\", \"So I had a little bit of a look through your charts.\", \"I think I understand why they did it.\", \"But did anybody explain it to you?Absolutely.\", \"And you know what?\", \"There\\'s no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive, like the two, we really want to know what the patient values in terms of, you know, things that are that invasive, and so absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want.\", \"But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital.So you pretty much showed up to emergency.\", \"And very quickly they put that tube down.Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that?they didn\\'t quite pick up on that.the two you\\'ve had.Okay.\", \"And so so you have congestive heart failure, and it sounds like you\\'ve got a breathing problem.\", \"Yes.\", \"And do you know why they would have put the tube down.\", \"Do you know what they were trying to do?Right.\", \"So it sounds like you understand that.\", \"I mean, usually we only put a tube in.\", \"If that was the only thing we could do to save you.\", \"Most of the time of congestive heart failure.\", \"We\\'ll give some medications.\", \"Have you heard of lasix?\", \"Or furosemide?\", \"No, okay.\", \"It\\'s a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don\\'t think we have time to give it that\\'s the time we would think of a breathing tube.\", \"haven\\'t had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.No, my know already what I\\'m hearing from you.\", \"Exactly.\", \"I\\'m just gonna say exactly what you\\'ve said, sounds like you\\'ve lived a good life.\", \"You\\'ve been through this a few times, you know exactly what it involves.\", \"And if I could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage.\", \"Is that correct?That\\'s an excellent question.\", \"So first, I did want to answer your previous question, based on what we\\'re talking about.\", \"Absolutely.\", \"I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we\\'re not going to put a breathing tube down again.\", \"And then of course, your second question, which is great, as well as how do we make sure this doesn\\'t happen?\", \"So what I\\'m going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too.\", \"And your reasons for why you don\\'t want it, which of course makes sense to me.\", \"And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care.\", \"And I just so it\\'s a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home.\", \"But I find that\\'s not usually enough.\", \"What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor.\", \"And that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta.\", \"And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn\\'t want the breathing to so I reassure you, we\\'ll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don\\'t want that to Okay.Okay.\", \"I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this.\", \"Go ahead.\", \"And the first question might sound a little off putting, but I sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want.\", \"We do have to ask, how was your mood?\", \"How are you feeling?\", \"Okay, excellent.\", \"And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital?\", \"Like when you\\'re healthy as healthy as you can be?\", \"Say a few weeks ago?Okay, great.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And then other related questions, we did talk about the two that we wouldn\\'t put it in.\", \"But again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want.\", \"Okay?\", \"So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you\\'d be willing to have?Okay.\", \"And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don\\'t want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone just found you at home, who had passed away.\", \"Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life?No, and that\\'ll make sense to me with no breathing.There are some other things we can do.\", \"That\\'s not a breathing tube, but they\\'re a little aggressive.\", \"And one is have you ever heard of bipap?It\\'s a mass that really pushes air into you.\", \"It\\'s a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube.\", \"Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don\\'t know what that is.\", \"But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time,Now, usually, most times with bipap?\", \"It\\'s only about two to six hours for most patients.we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff, and take you to the intensive care unit.\", \"Again, we wouldn\\'t do breathing too, but this is just to watch you closely.Okay.I do want to say that this is not set in stone, in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again.\", \"But if we don\\'t hear from you, this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart.\", \"I just want you to know that in case anything were to change,Absolutely.I don\\'t think you will either.\", \"But it\\'s just nice to see that you\\'re aware of that.\", \"Okay.\", \"Um, honestly, I mean, there\\'s some other questions.\", \"I tend to ask people when I don\\'t know them.\", \"Well, just kind of routine stuff.\", \"Okay.\", \"And maybe we\\'ll just quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure Anything else?Okay, that\\'s okay.\", \"We can usually we have it written down.\", \"Yeah, your medications.\", \"I think I saw you\\'re on aspirin and two jocks and I think two others.\", \"Do you happen to know or have them written down?Oh, so you are on the water pill?\", \"The furosemide.\", \"Okay, And.\", \"Okay, great.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Um, any allergies?\", \"Okay.\", \"And I won\\'t ask but anything that runs in your family, given your age, they told me you\\'re 70 Is that correct?\", \"Yes.\", \"And I do have to ask the following Questions completely unrelated to what we\\'re talking about.\", \"That\\'s okay.\", \"Do you smoke at all?drink any alcohol.Okay.\", \"And this will be sound crazy, but I have to ask any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that?to test any over the counter herbals In addition to these.And where are you living right now.Okay.\", \"And how do you feel about that?\", \"That changed six months ago.So you feeling better about being in that place now?\", \"A new homeSo I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected.\", \"Just one last time.\", \"Anything else you want to talk about today?Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, it\\'s very nice to meet you and Stone.So I understand that you\\'ve come in because you\\'re having a little difficulty in your relationship about that.Alright, so you\\'re looking for independence in your relationship.\", \"Now, how long have you been together?\", \"About a year?And when Franklin Did you notice that?\", \"What you kind of think it was the problem like the independence, lack of independence?\", \"So you\\'re looking for that freedom.\", \"Sarah, this kind of resonate with you?Can you can you tell him that?So Frank, what\\'s it like to hear that?So, Sarah, Do you sense that and, frankly, feels guilty about that?You feel rejected.So you mentioned that the six months to a year has been the same for you like was the beginning of the marriage, something different to what you have thatSo for you a couple months after that initial phase.\", \"So around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriageOkay, are you okay with some space?So maybe this, this idea of space isn\\'t really something you feel will work for you.Do want to try to address Frank\\'s concerns about the space?You seem apprehensive about it.So maybe just experiment with it, try it for one night and see what happens.\", \"So, in the year and a half, you\\'ve been married, Is there ever been a night when you\\'ve gone out by yourself?Okay, and what would happened, like in terms of like between you, so,all right, so this is really an experiment that\\'s already been tried.yeah.\", \"Just Just a few times.\", \"Is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week, it\\'ll be different?Don\\'t you don\\'t think so.Sir, what do you think about that?All right.\", \"So in terms of the going out, although going out with your friends wouldn\\'t have to be on the weekend that something could happen during the week.Okay, so you could agree.\", \"The both of you could agree to that as kind of terms of this behavioral experiment or weekends, you\\'ll spend those weekends together.Because that was a concern you specifically brought up.\", \"How about Sarah, how about the times during the week?\", \"How do you feel about those?You feel like you\\'d respond better to that?\", \"Would that be a better experience?Something that you think that you could try next week.So, let\\'s talk about when because you\\'ve gone out before and you said it was just getting out.\", \"Getting out the house that was the, the real challenge right?\", \"So walk me through.\", \"This really goes through both of you.\", \"What we through what happens when you\\'re when you\\'re getting ready to leave when you\\'re planning to head out?So ultimately, after all that you you do go, but you feel feel guilty.\", \"And do you have a good time?So sometimes you have a good time sometimes you don\\'t.\", \"You\\'re worried about Sarah being home.\", \"How about when you come home?Is that how you see it Sarah, the way Frank described it?so how about one is out?\", \"Like so after after he\\'s left?\", \"What do you What are you thinking that?\", \"Like?You\\'re anxious something bad\\'s gonna happen.Do you think that there\\'s been any reason for that thinking, like, do you think there\\'s any basis for thinking something bad\\'s gonna happen?\", \"Alright, so you\\'re really frustrated by not being able to go out, go out.\", \"But you\\'re anxious about when he goes out.\", \"So we talked about the possibility of like an experiment or you go out sounds like we might run to the same difficulties you experienced before.\", \"What can we change to increase the chances of that experiment working?So, so if you called when he was at Piedmont The answer is that\\'s something that\\'s normally possible.So that\\'s a compromise, you\\'d be willing to make.\", \"Absolutely something like that.\", \"You need any other reassurances from Frank, Sarah?Do you have a plan to call Frank?\", \"Like when he\\'s out?\", \"Or is it something that you would do if you just felt the need to orWere you calling for some specific reason?Why don\\'t you start reinsurance?\", \"Everything\\'s going right.\", \"Okay, so that seems reasonable to you.\", \"Right?\", \"I mean, I, I guessWould that be a good compromise?\", \"It was a text or two.\", \"I guess.\", \"That\\'s better than a phone call, right?\", \"Yeah.\", \"So not ideal, but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety a bit.\", \"Right?\", \"And maybe work toward a little bit more freedom.\", \"So that\\'s how I can experiment you both combined to try.Alright.\", \"So it\\'s not a perfect plan.\", \"But it\\'s one that you know, I would hope that we could be successful with if you could, though, you\\'re going through it, maybe track what happens, right, from your own perspective, like what you were thinking, the fact left, what you were thinking when you left, how it went, how that separation kind of was conducted.\", \"And what happened.\", \"Same thing when, while you\\'re out how many times you texted her If you called and then what happened when he got back?\", \"Right?\", \"That\\'s just kind of, and you can you can keep a record of those things just independently.\", \"You know, you write it down Come your experience and you write down your experience.\", \"And we\\'ll come back next time.\", \"No matter what happens with it, we\\'ll compare and kind of see what see what happened and how we could make adjustments to to make it work even better.between here and there, obviously, if it were easy, you wouldn\\'t need me, you wouldn\\'t have 13 therapists.\", \"If this were easy you would have been to a life you wanted a long time ago.\", \"So it\\'s obvious that it\\'s easy it already be done.\", \"Because it sounds like you\\'re a person with a lot of motivation works really hard, because there are very few people who wouldn\\'t quit before 13 therapists.\", \"So that\\'s a very good quality.\", \"The very fact that you\\'ve gone through all these therapists is a good sign for us.\", \"Nonetheless, it is difficult.\", \"between here and there, there\\'s going to be hell.\", \"Exactly.\", \"Right.\", \"So I figure our number one priority has to be to get you to stay alive through house so that we can get to the life you want.\", \"If that\\'s where we\\'re at.\", \"Now.\", \"We got to have some sort of agreement, not by writing a contract.\", \"Because I\\'ll fire you if you try to kill yourself that because we both sort of have to face the fact that to get there you got to go through there and to go through there you got to stay alive.What are you gonna do if I fail?Good.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"I understand you\\'ve come here today to the agency because you had a recent arrest.alcohol and marijuana.\", \"How recently was this DUI?\", \"About a week ago?\", \"Okay, so what\\'s been going on when that happened?get out of it.\", \"You mean get out of the charge?So you feel like you can get out of the rehab or two.So at this recent arrest, you realize it may be a value to stop using which really don\\'t want to Yeah, stuck there.when you drink Do you ever socialize the same time?alone so do the marijuanaso it doesn\\'t sound like you\\'re really worried about losing your social support if you stop using now early sweetie losingAny other reasons umforget about problems Yeah.\", \"So affects your mood in a positive way.Have you use since you had to do it?So you have the use it takes away pain for you to take swings xiety feels good.\", \"But then you have these consequences of the law.\", \"And you figure those two things out.You can imagine that.\", \"So it was a good the other side.\", \"Can you imagine having further it says law enforcement like more charges in the future.So you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there\\'s not a really heavy consequence.\", \"And you\\'ll be more careful in the future.So with that thinking, you continue to use as you were, that you would take out the part that got you in trouble.First you have to get out of trouble this time.So if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana, would you continue to use it?So there\\'s a social component here.So even if you had no anxiety, no pain You\\'d have to give up at least those interactions with your friends.\", \"How would they respond if you went out with them?\", \"I didn\\'t drink.So it\\'d be socially awkward.\", \"straining the relationships with your friends.\", \"So the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn\\'t seem like a good route for youBut then you have this distressing situation which is making you second guessed some of it.you need to make some change.\", \"Yeah, but not the alcohol.\", \"Drugs.Something else could change.So you could reduce your usage, avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal.\", \"Would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety of the pain?So that strategy might not work.\", \"That\\'s something you\\'ve been tossing around though, this idea of isolating a little bit more, and drinking a little less.\", \"Seems like all your options here kind of grim.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s just that\\'s just me doesn\\'t seem that way to you too.talking through it, yeah.have any choice?\", \"What\\'s going to happen is going to happen?All right.\", \"So let\\'s start with the lead now.\", \"Pick up with me now.\", \"You don\\'t want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with a DUI.\", \"What do you think you could do that would make a bad impression?I would do it.So you want to avoid those behaviors for sure.\", \"So you know, for sure you don\\'t want to have sex?\", \"Would it be acceptable those things anyway?So would you appreciate those skulls like avoiding those situations I go in the court truckGoals that you could get behindYou\\'re not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea.this is really tough for you is the outcome.\", \"The marriage laws are important.\", \"Yeah, this whole this book, do you I think it\\'s really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life with fat that is gonna change thingsBut if there\\'s a condition of your treatment, the judge says no more drinking is no more marijuana period.\", \"We can see that that if you obey those rules or word, jailI would think it almost certainly would have happened.\", \"Yeah.back a couple of steps.\", \"How long have you been using the alcohol marijuana?Have you ever until now with the DUI, have you ever envisioned stopping?\", \"Now, what\\'s your plan?\", \"Like pre d?\", \"Why was your plan and all this?Yeah.\", \"So without this or something you would have continued using?until now.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Could this be a strange way like an opportunity?If you really wanted to stop because your stuffyou could give a shot.\", \"You\\'re just not sure you could.\", \"You could actually do it.\", \"It\\'s just unknown.So where do you want to go from here you have this to you, I imagine a hearing or some type of Coming up here to see me.\", \"What can I do to help you?like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality.Okay, you want to work on that?\", \"Yeah.\", \"So between now I\\'m gonna see you again.\", \"Do you have any hearings or anything coming up?\", \"Now they\\'re not for like a few more weeks, few weeks.\", \"So I\\'ll see you again.\", \"And I have the IEP and everything here.\", \"second week.\", \"Let\\'s pick up with that.\", \"They think changes we\\'re hearing is moved up to slumping, okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Thank you.Hello Kathy, how are you today?I know when we spoke last time, you had some goals you want to talk about this time?\", \"You\\'re ready to do that?What do you have in mind?frustated Trying to lose the weight.\", \"Now you\\'d said before that you had a specific number of pounds of specific amount of weight to lose.\", \"You still have that in mind?Right, and you tried before?\", \"And what do you think got in the way?Yeah.Loss of focus.\", \"So you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted.Alright, so you know, how to lose weight.\", \"And you know, you can lose weight.\", \"But your focus is a little off when you\\'re trying and that\\'s causing the problem.\", \"Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units?\", \"Like say, five poundsIt\\'s just something you can do.for once a week.You mentioned the loss of focus is one problem.\", \"How about motivation, you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds and five pounds and so on.a little bit of that something extra to help you stay motivated.Okay.\", \"So some sort of activity or item that you enjoy, that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say that the first five poundsAll right.\", \"Do you have the activity or item in mind?\", \"We could put in place as something you could reward yourself with?Well, there\\'s a few ways we could do it.\", \"We could do that.\", \"So you reach five pounds.\", \"And then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day.\", \"If that day you\\'re successful in eating the way you want, he would you think would motivate you more?Yes, you know, each and every day as you\\'re trying to lose weight.\", \"You\\'re aware.\", \"When that day comes to close if you had a successful night, they were a less than successful day, right?\", \"If you have a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receiving items that we work out in advance that, you know, would motivate you.Right?\", \"So let\\'s let\\'s do that.\", \"On a day, you know, towards the evening.\", \"When you know, you have had a successful day and by what time would you know, in the evening?Let\\'s say some Okay, say so by 7pm at that point in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know, okay, right at 7pm, you\\'re aware.\", \"And at that point, if you have met your call, then you have a you have a TV show that you maybe it\\'s recorded on a TV or something you would watch, okay?\", \"And if you were not as successful you would write.\", \"So I\\'d be like something to keep you motivated about the day because you really want to watch that show.\", \"Right?\", \"A lot of fun.\", \"Do you think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days so it\\'s process?And this is something you could also track.\", \"Right?\", \"You could write down days that are successful days or lessons less than successful.\", \"And we could look at if there\\'s any patterns, maybe weekends are harder, because they\\'re easier or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or we\\'re less motivated.Okay, there\\'s the potential for every day to be different with what you\\'re exposed to, and what temptations in terms of different foods, what your schedules like maybe for busier things easier.\", \"So we can We can look at those different patterns.\", \"And we can add levels to this plan.\", \"Okay, but for now we\\'ll go with the TV show that you\\'ll watch sometime after seven, seven, you evaluate how you did, sometime after that.\", \"watch the show, okay?\", \"That\\'s like a plan.\", \"day by day, okay, this and five pound increments, okay, four times to get to your goal.\", \"20 pounds.\", \"Okay.\", \"Sounds good.\", \"So far.\", \"So, we\\'ll give that a shot.\", \"And we\\'ll take a look at the pattern that emerges, support everything.\", \"I say, write everything down.\", \"Okay, probably at around seven is a good time.\", \"When you know kind of day ahead, write down kind of what happened that day and whether you\\'ve had success or not.\", \"And bring that in.\", \"I\\'ll see you again week.\", \"So give us I\\'ll give you seven, seven days to work with.\", \"Okay?\", \"And we\\'ll look at that log of events.\", \"And we\\'ll reevaluate each week.starts tonight, okay.So we\\'ll give that a shot and I\\'ll see it a week.How do you know that?Okay.\", \"It would be good for me just to stop and ask you what, what is your ethnic and racial background?\", \"So after that encounter nets, third grade, your dad goes, he\\'s Latino.\", \"Goes to pick up your report card and to pick you up.\", \"How are you treated differently after that?And I\\'m sure none of it hurt at that point.Yeah.\", \"I do you think she\\'s emotionally guarded.\", \"Um, I think she\\'ll speak to that later in the session.\", \"You know, so it says I think there have been injuries.\", \"Some of which I\\'m going to guess really are related to the the race pieces that she\\'s experienced where she has felt judged under scrutiny and it just keeps repeating herself and it\\'s separate from competitors.\", \"Man accomplishments and so there is a guardedness and there is a sensitivity and the guardedness is her way of protecting some of her vulnerability.\", \"Okay, let\\'s move on toWhen you say,Okay, I mean, I\\'m having a couple three reactions to what you\\'re saying.\", \"I mean, one is that you\\'re saying you\\'re all the same andI mean, I\\'m feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now.\", \"I mean, it\\'s there\\'s something specific right now that I could say or do that that would fill, give you what you\\'re wanting or need.So you want sort of a, like a kind of, sort of like step by step description ofYeah.\", \"See, my sense is that you know, that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to, to get to give you some sense of hope.\", \"And, and I really want to be able to, you know, to give you something but but it feels like there\\'s something about the kind of intensity of your, of your sort of demand or play right now.\", \"Which, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that\\'s going to give you what you need.\", \"Or, you know, a better way of putting it is, you know, have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us and there\\'s something about the sort of intensity of your desperation with Which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to giveso it\\'s likeit sounds like it feels like you only have two choices, right that you can you can either approach the situation kind of on the attack, you know with with both guns blazing.\", \"It\\'s a good way to describeRight or or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way.\", \"Right.\", \"Right.\", \"Have those two which, which feels better, which feels worse?Right.\", \"Yeah, I can imagine that right that right, if you end up you know, at least if you\\'re going in there with with both guns blazing, there\\'s a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you\\'re not getting your needs met.\", \"Right.\", \"But somehow they\\'re, you know, sort of giving in, it\\'s like you\\'re giving away part of yourself in some way.\", \"So, I mean, you know, it seems to me that the you know, the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now, right.\", \"You sort of desperately need Something right, but a middle ground.\", \"There\\'s no middle ground.\", \"Okay.\", \"So, you know, I\\'m not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now.\", \"But I\\'m willing to work with you to, you know, to really work on discovering what that middle ground is.\", \"Does that does that seem worthwhile?Okay, but what are you feeling right now?There\\'s a real kind of sadness there.Look at me.\", \"The sense of what\\'s what\\'s going on for us?\", \"It sounds as if here.\", \"You\\'re asking for something.\", \"Yeah.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, I, you know, I hear that I hear the, you know, you\\'re sort of desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness.\", \"You know, when I\\'ll do my best to help youThanks for coming along today broke.\", \"I\\'ve really been looking forward to meeting you.Cool.\", \"Okay.\", \"So I just wanted to ask, did you receive that information pack that was sent out to you in the mail?\", \"Fabulous.\", \"Okay.\", \"So would you mind if we just spend a few minutes going through that together now?So I guess something really important that I would like to draw your attention to first of all, is this issue here of confidentiality, okay.\", \"Basically, everything that you and I talk about together in therapy is just between you and I, however, because I am a professional psychologist, the things that we discussed, I may need to share with my supervisor, okay.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s right.\", \"Yep.\", \"Yeah.\", \"There are a few special circumstances though, where I may have to break confidentiality.\", \"That is if you tell me that you might be of harm to yourself or someone else.\", \"Okay.\", \"If you tell me that you\\'ve been involved in a serious crime, okay for us.\", \"Somebody else wishes to access the information that we talked about in the context of legal proceedings and they take it off subpeona I\\'m required to give that information then okay.\", \"But of course, if any of these things ever did come up, I would discuss these with you first.\", \"Okay, that\\'d be good.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"All right.\", \"So something else I just would like to draw your attention to here as well.\", \"It\\'s just our fee here at the clinic.\", \"Yes.\", \"Which as we discussed on the phone is $20.Okay.\", \"And I understand from time to time that things can come up as well and that you might have to reschedule one of your appointment.\", \"We just asked that if you could provide us with about 24 hours notice beforehand shot so that gives us a chance to be able to set up another appointment time.Okay.\", \"Did you have any other questions about anything that you read on that shape there?Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"So if you wouldn\\'t mind just popping your signature at the bottom there.\", \"Thanks.Yeah, I can understand that it can be a bit confronting and scary The first time you come along.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So I guess, I mean, just to give you a bit of an idea about how I like to work with clients, is that I like it to be a collaborative approach so that the two of us get to work together on new problems and concerns that you\\'re having at the moment.\", \"Okay.\", \"So the purpose of today\\'s session, I guess, would be for me to get more of an understanding of what\\'s happening for you lately.\", \"All right, and give us a chance to get to know each other a little bit more.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s really good.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And at the end, we can sort of have a touch base again and see how we went for today and whether we\\'d like to take it on from there.Yes, yeah, exactly.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"So I mean, just to start off with then I guess, are there any other things that you\\'ve tried apart from coming to therapy and As some ways to help you cope with what\\'s happening for you.Yeah.\", \"We\\'ve been really keeping it to yourself and it\\'s quite a big step for you to reach out to to someone today.Okay, I guess to start off with him.\", \"Would you like to tell me a little bit more about what\\'s been happening for you?\", \"So what\\'s on the agenda for today.So let me so let me interrupt you for just a second here.\", \"Make sure I understand you.\", \"You\\'re really upset about your father getting on you this past week, right?\", \"Yeah.\", \"And it\\'s something that we could talk about today is just something that you think we could do to help the situation out?Well, one idea would be to get him to bring him in here and get him to back off, but he\\'s not here right now.\", \"And maybe there\\'s some things that you can do to help him calm down or back up the situation onWell, that may be but maybe there\\'s things you could do to be a little more assertive with him to let him know how you\\'re feeling?\", \"Or perhaps to calm the  situation down.okay, well, maybe we can put our heads together and come up with some strategies to deal with your dad a little bit better.\", \"All right.\", \"Is that suddenly?\", \"Is that something we could put down in the agenda then?do I describe that then?\", \"dealing with my dad.\", \"Okay.\", \"Dealing with Dad.\", \"Is there anything else you\\'d like to put on the agenda?So I put down tired and sleep.\", \"So we have dealing with dad and tired and sleep.\", \"Which thing do you want to talk about first?Okay.\", \"So we don\\'t want to forget about the homework.\", \"So we want to make sure we put that down on the agenda.\", \"And so, you want to talk about dealing with your dad, get do the homework first.\", \"Tough on my dad do definitely with your dad.\", \"Okay.\", \"So we want to make sure we allow enough time to talk about your homework is it\\'s important.\", \"So tell me what happened this past week with your dad.Amanda, thanks for coming in tonight.The GP sent me a letter telling me a little bit about what\\'s been happening.\", \"That\\'s been having some difficulties since birth for some of you weeks ago.\", \"Tell me a little bit about what\\'s been happening from yourBut it hasn\\'t.\", \"It hasn\\'t been a good time.what has what has it been like for you?so wrong?It\\'s meant to be feeling thisThese this thing that has been so important, and now that it\\'s, it\\'s here, now that\\'s happened.\", \"It\\'s different to the way that you imagined Please tell me a little bit more about that part that\\'s struggling.Just want everything to go on?And this is the place that you can say what needs to be said.\", \"So, feeling as though it\\'s all on you.\", \"You\\'re going to deal with it all the time.\", \"By yourself withSo trying to keep a mask up.\", \"Trying to seem as though it\\'s okay.But it\\'s painful.\", \"It\\'s a painful feeling.so at this point, and it\\'s six weeks, they\\'ve been a really rough.\", \"Six weeks feels to me like really rough.\", \"Having waited so long to have this child gone through the birth and understand from a GPM pump was a somewhat difficult birth if it wasn\\'t from I thought it was.\", \"So from the very start, it hasn\\'t been as you thought.And now you\\'re at that point where the reality is the reality of this baby.\", \"It sounds to me that there\\'s a struggle going on for you.\", \"But a struggle that you\\'re feeling very much alone withSo, Felicity, I think that we\\'ve done a lot of good work today.\", \"And I\\'m delighted that you didn\\'t have a panic attack last week.\", \"That\\'s really impressive.\", \"And you seem really pleased about that as well.\", \"And so, you know, I think today we\\'ve run through a couple of more techniques that you can use to manage your anxiety.\", \"And it seems to me that you\\'ve got a good grip on those.\", \"Good.\", \"That\\'s fantastic.\", \"Well, I guess if we wind up now, and then meet again, next week.\", \"Yeah.Ohh really?\", \"Yeah, I can imagine so he has been really upset by that.Yes, I can see that really causes you more anxiety as well that this is happening and yeah, you feel criticized by your mom and perhaps torn a bit between your mom\\'s view and David?\", \"Yeah, I do.\", \"You talk to him.so felicity.\", \"I\\'m very pleased that you didn\\'t have a panic attack last week.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And and so are you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I\\'m hoping that the work that we did today, in looking at a couple more techniques of how you can manage the anxiety has been helpful to you.week.\", \"Good.\", \"And we\\'ve discussed your homework.\", \"Yes.\", \"So expert welding perhaps if we wrap up for today.No,I can see that this is very upsetting for you.\", \"felicitated is an issue that you\\'ve raised before.\", \"So I\\'m wondering whether we should decide that for next week, we\\'ll start to discuss these issues that you\\'re having with your mom so that we can work out a plan when we\\'ve got our next session.\", \"How would that be?\", \"And I can see that that\\'s a really big issue.\", \"So I think we definitely will put this on a number one agenda for next week.\", \"Okay.\", \"And so We\\'ll work on a theme because this is clearly very important to you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I think that we\\'re going to need a good chunk of time to be able to help you to resolve some of these issues with your mom.\", \"I can\\'t How about during the week on?\", \"In addition to the other homework you have, you have to think about what the issues are that you would like to raise with me next week about this.It sounds like that\\'s going to be a very important thing to do, because I can see how distressed This makes you feel.\", \"Okay, ready?\", \"Okay.\", \"So we\\'ll meet again, same time next week.\", \"Thanks Felicity.Okay, Felicity, before we start to talk about what you\\'ve come here to see me for today, I just wanted to raise an issue with you.\", \"I think we both realized when you walked in here that we\\'ve seen each other before.\", \"That\\'s right.\", \"That\\'s right.\", \"We do run into each other, a fair bit at the kindergarten.\", \"So I suppose what that brings up for me is that I\\'m a psychologist, and there is certain boundaries that I have to uphold with my clients.\", \"And I think that we need to talk about what we\\'re going to do about this, that we we do see each other quite often and how we\\'re going to manage that in terms of, you know, keeping those appropriate boundaries within therapy and outside the therapy room.\", \"So how I say this, we have a few different options.\", \"The first one is that we could decide not to engage in therapy together.\", \"Given that, you know, there could be some issues when we see each other outside of therapy.\", \"Okay, how would that option sit for you?\", \"Yeah, psycho psychology services are quite limited in this area.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"So you really feel that you need the help and this is the only option that you\\'ve got.\", \"So given that that\\'s the case.\", \"How do you think we could manage this one we do run into each other outside of the therapy rooms so that we don\\'t cross over you know, the boundaries of therapists and clients.\", \"So if I see you at the kindergarten shall we acknowledge each other and you know, keep walking or how would you like to manage it?\", \"Sure, sure.\", \"And I\\'m really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it\\'s fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"I\\'m glad that you think that it that would not be appropriate.\", \"No, no, I\\'m, I would definitely keep it confidential, that we\\'re in a therapeutic relationship together.\", \"Nobody else needs to yet be aware of that.\", \"Okay.\", \"That\\'s exactly right.\", \"So if we could just keep it at you know, those things separate then I don\\'t think we should run into any problems in therapy.\", \"Yeah, but perhaps we could check in from time to time to see you know, whether that It\\'s becoming a problem for  Do you think that sounds okay?\", \"Yep.\", \"All right.\", \"So now that we\\'ve discussed that issue, yeah.\", \"Let\\'s talk about why you\\'ve come in to talk to me today.\", \"Jasmine Hi, my name is Heidi I\\'m your counselor today.\", \"We\\'re going to meet in a room to our left something a bit more private in this area and here.So we\\'re just going to go up the hole and to the right and then there\\'s a room on the left.\", \"Should I go first?Come in Jasmine.\", \"This is the room.\", \"That will be Meeting in today and if you come back again, we\\'ll be in this room again.\", \"What I want you to do first is perhaps have a look around and choose where you would like to sit.\", \"where you\\'d like to be.\", \"Just the big chair over there.\", \"Yeah, so when you\\'re ready, just make your way over to the chair.\", \"And I\\'ll close the door.\", \"And from where you\\'re sitting now, where do you think you\\'d like me to be in the room?Okay.\", \"So what invite you year to look around, look around the room.\", \"Take in this new space.\", \"You\\'ve never been here before.\", \"See if there\\'s something your eyes want to rest on or if there\\'s anything pleasant to your eyes ever really good sticky baked around the room.\", \"Most people most time to come into new environments.\", \"We want to have a good sticky bacon.\", \"We don\\'t and you can in here.\", \"Now imagine it\\'s pretty tough for you to be here.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"What would help you to spend a moment here?What\\'s it like to have that pillow against your tummy?Yeah.\", \"What\\'s it like to have your hands holding tight?\", \"They\\'re like that.How did you how did you get here?She\\'s still here.Is there an arrangement to pick you up?\", \"Man, you\\'re looking at the time.\", \"So what time did you arrange for mom to pick you up?In half an hour.\", \"So notice you\\'re looking around a little bit more now.\", \"helps a bit more with that pillow doesn\\'t it?\", \"That was a good idea for you to put the pillow there.\", \"So how long do you think you\\'d like to be here?\", \"If you had a choice of how long you were going to be here with me in this conversation, how long would it be?\", \"Okay, maybe, maybeFeel better.\", \"Yeah.\", \"You can just call mom and tell her that the first session is shorter.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Because it\\'s enough hearts really confronting to be here.\", \"A lot of people find it confronting to come here because of the name of the agency.\", \"The issues that we may talk about in the future.\", \"It\\'s pretty good.\", \"confronting.\", \"So just getting used to being here is a pretty big deal.\", \"And you\\'re doing a great job.\", \"You\\'re doing really well.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I\\'m here with youYeah, it\\'s hard just just just come back to me just come back to the room a little bit.\", \"Can you just look up, look up, look up at me.\", \"We\\'ll call out I still have can check it out.good events trying to get you back back into the room with me.\", \"Okay, so just look around the Can you see me this painting that\\'s up here?\", \"What do you say to me other paintings?\", \"I just want you to catch this for me so we can throw it back to me.\", \"Okay, this fell back to me I see that\\'s a good good start back to me.\", \"Good Practice saving stay here and stay here in the room with me here.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And also get your character on that\\'s it.\", \"Okay, so just just want you to just to keep in the room with me a bit and sometimes it\\'s a bit bit stressful and overwhelming.\", \"Okay, but we\\'re still connected.\", \"Okay, you\\'re back there.\", \"Okay.\", \"How you feeling?\", \"Yeah,completely understand why things are really, really tough moment.\", \"And that sort of conversations with a place in town could be very stressful for you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I get Yeah.\", \"So maybe a feeling now, where you are?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay, so maybe just want to keep talking.\", \"Just remember that we\\'re connected.\", \"Okay.\", \"And you\\'re here with me.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So tell me a little bit more.\", \"So your mom came to, to the to the statement?And how are you feeling now after you\\'ve done it all?it was really understandable.\", \"It\\'s completely, you know, understandable that sometimes it\\'s difficult to talk.\", \"And sometimes you can afford back to tough times.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So we just keep talking.\", \"I would keep talking like thisHello, Sophia.\", \"I\\'m good.\", \"How are you?I saw you last time a week ago.\", \"And I know you\\'ve had some concerns with employment working on employment.\", \"The first before we get into that I wanted to check in and see how you\\'re doing emotionally.\", \"I know from last week, on a scale of one to 10 you said you were suffering from depression at about seven.\", \"Yeah.\", \"How is it today?So you\\'re having some concerns about full time work and that level of energy, you\\'d have to exert that commitment.\", \"Alright, so we\\'ll be okay today, if we kind of structured, what we\\'re going to do sure for for this session.\", \"So, if it\\'s okay with you, I\\'d like to talk about that.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right and and get some more details about kind of what\\'s going on this week and your feelings surrounding that.\", \"And we touched on this a little bit in the last session.\", \"But I\\'d like to talk about kind of your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing some of these feelings of depression.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And then, for the last part, we\\'ll work on like we did before, interventions to try to help you with with what\\'s going on at work and with your depressed mood.\", \"And we can make changes to this as needed.\", \"I just want to start with an outline that we can, we can have going in okay.\", \"So make sense.\", \"Okay.\", \"Anything you want to add or take away from that?Okay.\", \"So, tell me a little bit more about what\\'s going on with the work.So, the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you.So getting up in the morning and getting to work on time.\", \"You do okay with that.So the work program you\\'re in now, you work in the morning?What hours are you there?And there\\'s some work you have to do in the afternoon.Thinking about it\\'s exhausting.\", \"Can you tell me what type of thoughts you\\'re having?I don\\'t think I can just there\\'s just too many hours.So, can you think of another case you\\'re working on another family different than the one that we\\'ve initially talked about?\", \"Where you\\'ve made a decision that seemed like was fairly clear caught like one you would have made before and yet you\\'re, you\\'re thinking about it replaying it?Right.\", \"So you\\'re handling it to the best of your ability.\", \"But there\\'s still these these thoughts that are coming out.\", \"Kind of encouraging you to second guess your judgment?Maybe what if, what if the worst happens?So it speaks back to your competency as a professional again.\", \"So that\\'s, that seems to be court this.\", \"I think Here are several things you talk about seem to connect back to.\", \"Are you capable to be in this field?\", \"And should you be trusted?So coming back to thinking there are errors and thinking that all people make.\", \"And when these errors become repetitive and you can kind of see them applied in more than one areas of his life.\", \"We refer to that as a cognitive distortion.\", \"Okay?\", \"It\\'s not bad or good.\", \"It\\'s just how people think.\", \"It\\'s just patterns that people fall into.\", \"And there are several different cognitive distortions, there\\'s several patterns that we kind of see.\", \"come up often in this work, right as a counselor, wondering, in the situation where you\\'re thinking, the worst possible outcome is unbearable, or likely or both.\", \"If you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that, to the exclusion of other evidence that suggests you\\'ve made a good decision.\", \"I see you\\'re really focused on the negative outcome, the worst possible and maybe even unlikely outcome.\", \"And maybe not weighing all the evidence with the same weight, like you\\'re putting more weight on the negative pay, that kind of makes sense.This is frustrating for you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"The self doubt is worrying.Yeah, it\\'s hard just just just come back to me just come back to the room a little bit.\", \"Can you just look up, look up, look up at me.\", \"We\\'ll call out I still have can check it out.good events trying to get you back back into the room with me.\", \"Okay, so just look around the Can you see me this painting that\\'s up here?\", \"What do you say to me other paintings?\", \"I just want you to catch this for me so we can throw it back to me.\", \"Okay, this fell back to me I see that\\'s a good good start back to me.\", \"Good Practice saving stay here and stay here in the room with me here.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And also get your character on that\\'s it.\", \"Okay, so just just want you to just to keep in the room with me a bit and sometimes it\\'s a bit bit stressful and overwhelming.\", \"Okay, but we\\'re still connected.\", \"Okay, you\\'re back there.\", \"Okay.\", \"How you feeling?\", \"completely understand why things are really, really tough at the moment.\", \"And that sort of conversations with a place in town could be very stressful for you.\", \"So maybe a feeling now, where you are?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay, so maybe just want to keep talking.\", \"Just remember that we\\'re connected.\", \"Okay.\", \"And you\\'re here with me.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So tell me a little bit more.\", \"So your mom came to, to the to the statement?And how are you feeling now after you\\'ve done it all?It was really understandable.\", \"It\\'s completely, you know, understandable that sometimes it\\'s difficult to talk.\", \"And sometimes you can afford back to tough times.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So we just keep talking.\", \"I would keep talking like thisSue, it\\'s good to see you again.\", \"I was hoping today, I could give you a test of your memory, you feel good about that?Okay.\", \"So I\\'m going to read a series of questions and ask you to do some different things.\", \"And this will just take a few minutes.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So what is today\\'s date?10th.\", \"What is today\\'s year?what is the month?What day is today?Can you also tell me what season it is?Can you also tell me the name of this clinic?What floor Are we on?What city are we in?What County are we in?Dover County?\", \"What state Are we in?So, I\\'m going to test your memory.\", \"I want to read these three words.\", \"And I want you to repeat them back to me.Ball, flag.\", \"Tree.\", \"Can we get those back?Let me do that again.\", \"Okay.\", \"Ball, flag and tree.All right.\", \"I want you to remember those because I\\'d ask you to repeat them again later on.Can you begin with the number 100 and count backwards by seven?continueOkay, that\\'s good.Can you spell the word world backwards?Right?\", \"I want you to name the three words that I asked you to remember a few moments ago.Okay, let\\'s take that was it Can you tell me what this is?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Can you tell me what this is?I\\'m going to say a phrase.\", \"I\\'d like you to repeat it back to me exactly as I say.\", \"Okay, all right.\", \"phrase is No ifs, ands, or buts.Are you right handed or left handed?I\\'d like you to take this piece of paper from me in your right hand.\", \"fold the paper in half and put the paper on the floor.\", \"OkayYou can use bothany any complete sentenceHello, Mr.\", \"Taylor.\", \"My name is Dr.\", \"vinita.\", \"And I\\'m one of the psychiatrists who works here right.\", \"Okay, can you tell me what\\'s brought you here today?I see, do you think you\\'re drinking too much?Right?\", \"Maybe we can just explore that a little bit more.\", \"Yeah.\", \"How much would you say you drank in a day?\", \"Now?about bottle of vodka.\", \"And how long have you been drinking that much for?a few years, can you make it a more specific two years?\", \"Three years?\", \"Five years?Okay, so you\\'d say of about the last two years three.\", \"Okay.\", \"And do you drink anything else apart from vodka?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And would that be every day?right and how much is a few?\", \"Okay.\", \"And then so on a weekday I\\'ve got about you take about you have about two to four pints afterwards and then you come home and drink about a bottle of vodka.\", \"Yeah, well,when do you start drinking during the day?\", \"On an average day,Right.\", \"So after breakfast, and again, when did that start?Okay.\", \"And what about the weekends at the same at the weekend?\", \"And would you drink you go to the pub at lunchtime at the weekend?\", \"Would you drink more than a bottle of vodka during the day or the weekend?\", \"No.\", \"It\\'d be about the same.\", \"Okay, and then the rest regular time when you drink more than what you tell me.\", \"Okay, so And is it just beer and vodka?\", \"Or do you drink wine?Then would you say you have to drink more to get the same effect from the from the alcohol?some common effect?\", \"Do you have days where you don\\'t drink or periods where you don\\'t drink?\", \"When was the last time you had that?for how long did that last forand it In that time did you experience any?\", \"any physical feelings at all?Did you ever feel?\", \"Do you ever get those similar sorts of feelings in the morning when you wake up?you do.\", \"And what happens yet when you have a drink in the morning that makes you feel better?\", \"Does, right?\", \"Yeah.\", \"If you don\\'t have that drink in the morning, what happensand you work as a bank manager.\", \"Okay.\", \"Has anyone has anyone commented apart from your wife about your drinking?\", \"Have you ever had any more serious health problems from your drinking?\", \"Have you ever seen a doctor or had sometimes people get loss of memory or Fitz Shams?\", \"Very serious shakes, they need to go into hospital.And did that show anything?Right?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And how did you feel about that?So I can see that it\\'s had quite an impact at home.\", \"Yeah, well, but outside the home, how\\'s your drinking affected jobs or anything else?\", \"My job about relationships other than your wife with family friends?\", \"Well, any other serious consequences?\", \"Yeah,Okay, thanks for coming to talk to me today.So How you doing today?\", \"I heard you.\", \"I\\'m doing Okay, thanks for asking.\", \"What\\'s your name?\", \"And which hands you normally write?\", \"Right?\", \"Right hand would be all right to ask you some questions about your memory.What season of the year is this?What is the date today?what day of the week is this?What month is this?Can you tell me what country we\\'re in?What County are we in?What city are we in?What is the name of this building?What floor of the building are we on?I\\'m going to name three objects.\", \"After I\\'ve set them, I want you to repeat them back to me.\", \"Apple table, Penny Remember what they are.\", \"Because I\\'m going to ask you to name them again in a few minutes.Now, spell it backwards.\", \"What were the three objects I asked you to remember?What is this called?What is this called?I would like you to Repeat the phrase after me.\", \"The phrase is no ifs, ands, no buts.\", \"read the words on this page.\", \"Then do what it says.Take this paper in your right hand.\", \"Fold the paper once with hands and put the paper down on your lap.So you made your bed.\", \"That\\'s great.\", \"really makes a difference.\", \"How did waking up earlier ago?I thought that might happen.\", \"So I made this sign for you.\", \"It\\'ll help you remember to set the alarm.How did that go?Well, that\\'s why I bought you these.\", \"We can put your dirty clothes in To the hamper.\", \"And your clean clothes, you can fold them up and put them into this bin.Well last time we talked about how you forget to take a shower, so I brought you this hygiene basket because remember if you become overwhelmed, if you keep it here by the bed, it\\'ll remind you to take a shower and you can carry it with you.I\\'ll put the calendar up for you and also put this picture I love up here by the bed.\", \"Well, guess what?\", \"I got you a container so you can put all your meds in.\", \"If you fill it up for each day, and keep it by your bed with a glass of water.\", \"It will remind you to take your pillsSounds good.\", \"I\\'ll put up your calendar.Hello, Sarah, how you doing today?I understand that you\\'ve come to counseling because you have a particular issue that\\'s been bothering you recently.are you okay talking about that today.So I\\'d like to do in the beginning, is kind of set a plan for our meeting today, okay.\", \"And we can move off that plant if we need to, but I just like to start with that, and give us some structure to what we\\'ll be doing.\", \"So, first, and this is something I want to co create with you, right?\", \"So your input is extremely valuable to it.\", \"I don\\'t want to just lay it out and we follow it.\", \"I want you to be an active part of putting this together.\", \"So as I throw out some ideas, let me know if it\\'s something that makes sense to you or doesn\\'t.\", \"Okay?\", \"I\\'d like to start by having you explain in depth kind of what you\\'re going through at work.\", \"I know it\\'s troubling you and I want to hear that story.\", \"Then you\\'re going to look for some patterns in the way you\\'re thinking And see if there\\'s something that I recognized all that something I can point out, that may help you a bit.\", \"And we\\'ll get more to that later.\", \"And then to kind of as we wrap up with towards the end, maybe start getting some ideas of things you can do between sessions between now and we\\'ll see you next time that can help combat these symptoms make you feel better.\", \"Okay.\", \"Does that seem like a fairly straightforward agenda?\", \"Any changes or anything you\\'d like to make to that?We\\'ll see.\", \"Okay.\", \"So, you know, you just kind of tell me what\\'s going on as you feel comfortable.\", \"And don\\'t worry about the agenda.\", \"Okay.\", \"Just know that overall, that\\'s kind of what I\\'m thinking about for the structure.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then You know, as we as we wrap up, we\\'ll set to make an appointment next time and, and like I said, we\\'ll end up with some ideas, I hope they can help you.\", \"So let\\'s get started with kind of, you know, your experience with all this.\", \"So tell me about your, your job.This is really stressful.So you\\'d like some make sure I understand.\", \"You like your job?\", \"But this, this dealing you\\'ve had with this particular family.\", \"And what happened as a result of that dealing has just really thrown you for a loop.So it\\'s really drastically changed the work experience.So there\\'s a sense of dread, anxiety.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Do you feel doubtful?It\\'s not not a good feelingMy sense is that you\\'re trying to say something and then you just kind of almost like gave up there.Are you feeling angry at me?Right.\", \"So, you know, I understand that you\\'re pissed in general.\", \"But are you angry at me?\", \"I mean, it sounds to my senses here that you\\'re feeling angry at me right now.\", \"If you are.\", \"I really want to know about it.yeah, you\\'re sounding really exasperated to me.\", \"How does it feel to tell me about this?Okay, so I want to push you too hard.\", \"But can you say any more about that while you\\'re what\\'s uncomfortable bother.\", \"So I mean, I do understand that it\\'s uncomfortable.\", \"I mean,So, I mean, part of it sounds like is you\\'re concerned that I\\'m going to feel like you\\'re blaming me.sounds really important, right?\", \"It sounds like you\\'re you know, it\\'s hard to say this.\", \"But you\\'re you know, you\\'re feeling angry of the maybe you feeling disappointed?\", \"You\\'re feeling all alone.\", \"Yeah, like you can\\'t even really talk with me about this.Okay.Okay, so let\\'s so at least it\\'s out there.\", \"Right.So let\\'s talk about this.\", \"So those type of thoughts, like I can\\'t make a mistake or something like that.\", \"We call this automatic thoughts.\", \"And we\\'ll have plenty of time talk about the different structures in CBT.\", \"I do want to explain it to you but over the course of several sessions, let\\'s just take pieces of it for now.\", \"Okay.\", \"So far we believe is that your beliefs combined with a situation and create these thoughts.\", \"So you have this belief, so you\\'re laying in bed for work, and you have this belief that you\\'re maybe not competent.\", \"And then the situation that combines with that is, it\\'s time to go to work.\", \"So the stress of No, it being time to actually get up and get ready to work.\", \"And then you have an automatic thought in that moment.\", \"Can right now it\\'s one tied to dread and fear.\", \"Let\\'s try to identify an exact one for this example.\", \"So let\\'s use that scenario.\", \"You believe that you might not be confident you\\'re laying in bed, and the alarm clock goes off.\", \"So you\\'re kind of pressured to make a decision about do I get ready for work or not?\", \"What\\'s the thought right then?So if I go, I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"And then we talked about your reactions being late.\", \"Worry, anxiety.\", \"So what we\\'d like to do when we identify on that felt like that is what\\'s called self talk.\", \"And it first this may seem a little odd, right?\", \"So you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image.\", \"But it\\'s cognitive in nature.\", \"And I can\\'t make a mistake, like, I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"That\\'s your thought.\", \"And the self talk.\", \"This is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems so odd The first time I do it.\", \"So really, you\\'re talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief.\", \"Okay?\", \"It first though it\\'s going to seem quite foreign to you.\", \"Tell me how you how you\\'re processing this now.\", \"It\\'s a good question.\", \"We\\'ll work on that.\", \"And that\\'s what we can do now.\", \"Let\\'s take a look at some self talk.\", \"So some adaptive responses so they can build.\", \"So I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"That\\'s the automatic thought that\\'s directly leading.\", \"Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time.\", \"Has there ever been times when you\\'ve had that thought?\", \"And you went to work on time still?\", \"What was different about those times?Alright, so when you do that, in essence, you are applying self talk.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So that\\'s, that\\'s really the same thing except you probably didn\\'t have a label for it.\", \"And when you apply that it seems to work.\", \"So the message you\\'re kind of sending yourself now you\\'re telling yourself is I\\'m going to make a mistake still.\", \"But if I\\'m late for work, I\\'ll be worse.\", \"So there\\'s a little bit of positive and negative in here.\", \"Right self talk doesn\\'t have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity.\", \"I\\'d rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, so that\\'s pretty good self talk you have now let\\'s work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.How many times have you gone to work and made a mistake?So none, but there might be a few small ones that you\\'ve just never found out about.\", \"So Less than a 10th of a percent days you come in probably very small, really, really small.\", \"The probability of a statement that you\\'re making being true, is pretty low.\", \"The seventh thought rather, I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"Probably not supported by the evidence.So, the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful.\", \"I just got a couple strikes against it.\", \"But it is the thought you\\'re having so let\\'s deal with it.\", \"I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"So what could you tell yourself as the first part of that adaptive response, which acknowledges that fear that\\'s realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistakeEverybody makes mistakes.\", \"I could make a mistake today, but it\\'s unlikely that that also be accurate.\", \"So everybody makes mistakes.\", \"I could make a mistake, but it\\'s probably not gonna happen.\", \"Rather than I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"So you\\'re going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while until you start to apply these adaptive responses.\", \"So this is what we\\'re working on is your response.\", \"So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake probably not going to happen.\", \"And will could be a next part, which is realistic, but also positive.\", \"That can help get you past the reaction of being late morning.Okay, so there\\'s a few few elements in there.\", \"It\\'s going to be okay, I need to do my The job I help people all those all those are true So applying as you know even as you say this year with me as you say, it\\'s gonna be okay I need to my shop.\", \"What are we actually having right now?Can you see yourself being able to in the moment and I realize this is difficult but in the moment of having that on that thought and that word come in.\", \"Can you see yourself applying this self talk?And you\\'ve already used self talk on your own before even knew about these?A lot of the corsage to some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training.\", \"Right, just like many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention correct decision.\", \"So think of this kind of like something you\\'ve learned in the training.\", \"This is a self talk.\", \"It\\'s pre packaged, it\\'s ready to go.\", \"You can even have it written down.\", \"Okay?\", \"Doesn\\'t have to be short.\", \"It can be like a paragraph, or more if you want as a matter of following the protocol.\", \"Once you have the automatic thought, it\\'s easy to descend into worry and fear.\", \"You\\'re just looking too quick to grab a moment in there.\", \"Apply this treatment strategy.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Sometimes it\\'s likely Well, most of the time, I think you would you would be able to do this.\", \"Sometimes you probably won\\'t as important in those moments to not get discouraged.\", \"Right.\", \"So you can have a self talk for that to write something like Dr.\", \"Crowley said it was likely that once a while I wouldn\\'t build do this.Make sense?So it\\'s the chaos of life, right in the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere.\", \"the more times you have success, that that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptoms, but allow yourself failures.\", \"Well, it\\'s what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts.\", \"There\\'s not gonna be a perfect connection between that automatic thought and applied self talk.\", \"Okay, so be easy on yourself as soon as you can,It\\'d be good shape, right?\", \"so it\\'s a little more difficult than that.\", \"But overall, this these strategies are fairly straightforward.\", \"And you can definitely learn them and you can definitely do them.\", \"I want you to have that confidence.\", \"It\\'s, it\\'s normal to have mistakes occur.\", \"And to not always do it as you need to as you want to, but in the end, overall, you should be able to be able to apply them and actually It\\'ll get easier in the future to develop your self talk for different thoughts.\", \"Okay?So you mentioned before that when you wake up in the morning, you you don\\'t want to go to work, what\\'s going through your mind?So looking into one I\\'m going to make a mistake.\", \"That kind of connects to what we were talking about before it says the uncertainty, you\\'re not sure of your own skills and you\\'re afraid of an error that\\'s going to be costly.\", \"So when you think that thought, I\\'m gonna make a mistake, so this is when you\\'re, when you\\'re in bed before you start your day, and you have that thought, what happens right then?So there\\'s emotional consequences.\", \"And then the behaviors.\", \"You don\\'t want to get out of bed.When you\\'re staying in bed, are you under more thoughts coming up?So this is really weighing on you.\", \"And he was edified these thoughts that seem to be connected with feelings that are unpleasant, and behaviors are unpleasant, but also maybe not useful.So we have a reference point for later on as we continue counseling.\", \"I\\'d like to scale this problem like maybe on a scale of one to 10, where 10 represents feelings that are nearly unbearable, right?\", \"And one not really a problem.\", \"How do you feel on that scale?\", \"Where do you rate yourself right now?How would you rate yourself when you\\'re in bed before you go to work?\", \"So an eight sometimes nine, right now five, so still not feeling great.\", \"Have you had to pick an emotion of standing out above the rest in anxiety, sadness, sense of dread.\", \"What would be the worst right now?So five, on a scale 10 inside is really standing out moreHi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.\", \"So I don\\'t know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you\\'re even here.\", \"So I thought I\\'d start by telling you a little bit about myself.\", \"Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester, and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life.\", \"If you decide that you do it\\'s not my job to change you.\", \"I couldn\\'t even if I wanted to.\", \"That\\'s not my role at all.\", \"It\\'s really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward.\", \"That sound okay ?All right.\", \"So why don\\'t we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?OhWow.\", \"You really are involved in music.When did you start?Wow.Yeah, very cool.\", \"Y\\'ve always wanted to be good at music.\", \"Alright, so it sounds like you\\'re in band and a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun.\", \"It\\'s kind of everyday, sort of thing ?Tell me a little bit about your family.Cute.\", \"What  kind of dog ?Oh, nice.Very funny.\", \"All right, and how are things going in school for you?\", \"Okay, great.\", \"So you\\'re doing well?\", \"What sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school?Ohh Alright.Okay.\", \"You have some pretty big dreams.\", \"It\\'s great.\", \"It\\'s really exciting to think about that and be looking forward to the future and those things.All right.\", \"Well, one thing I\\'m going to ask you about is, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life, whether it\\'s, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that.\", \"Here\\'s the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community.\", \"Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self determination and spirituality.\", \"So when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?Okay.Okay,Okay.Okay, great.\", \"So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging, like you said, sort of a sense of purpose.\", \"And then the respect is really sort of all encompassing, not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you.Okay, that\\'s great.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends, so What kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?And when you\\'re hanging out with friends, Is there ever alcohol involved.okay, can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?Mm hmm.\", \"And so when you go to parties, most of the time, there\\'s alcohol there.Okay.\", \"And how often do you think you would say you\\'re drinking?So about half the time you\\'re drinking and half the time you\\'re not.Can you tell me what\\'s different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohol is there.Okay?\", \"And do you notice a big difference?\", \"Or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at, say a party versus the night you\\'re playing board games?Okay, so they\\'re sort of pros and cons.\", \"Okay.\", \"What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?Okay.\", \"So sort of in the too much drinking or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things are not so good things about alcohol?Okay So you\\'re trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities.\", \"You\\'re trying to stay put you\\'re not driving or trying to stay with people that you trust.\", \"But yeah, it sounds like there\\'s still some some things happening.\", \"can you tell me a little bit about that?Yeah.\", \"Throwing up is never fun.And how often do you think that happens?Uh huh.\", \"Okay, so on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sort of carefree.\", \"Let loose a little bit more.\", \"On the other hand, there\\'s a little bit more, I guess.\", \"Planning involved because you have to make sure that you\\'re doing it safely or as safe as you can.\", \"And then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it\\'s not you that sometimes you\\'re stuck.\", \"Your fun is sort of ruined when you\\'re stuck dealing with a friend who drink too much.\", \"Okay, and the other not so good things about the alcohol,That kind of stuff.\", \"So you\\'re kind of stuck being exposed to things.All right.\", \"Well, you mentioned a couple times that you\\'ve made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking.\", \"Why did you make those decisions?okay.\", \"It sounds kind of similar to your, your value of respect to so on the one hand, you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.\", \"If there\\'s too much, then it sort of defeats the purpose.And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.\", \"How do you think that the drinking fits in with that ?Yes.Okay.\", \"So you\\'re sort of looking for that balance?\", \"How much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit, but not crossover.\", \"Okay.\", \"And what have you come up with at this point?\", \"Do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or  ?And do you feel like that\\'s working pretty well for you?\", \"Or do you sometimes exceed that limit?\", \"Or, or what do you think ?\", \"So a portion of the time it\\'s working well for you and another portion of the time you Maybe you, like you\\'d like to make some adjustments to make it a little smoother.\", \"Okay, so kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself.Uh huh.\", \"So kind of combined  goals.Okay.\", \"So you\\'re you have a goal.\", \"It sounds like actually cutting back on your drinking.\", \"How important is it to you to work on that goal on on a scale of one to 10 Where one is not at all important.\", \"And 10 is it\\'s the most important thing right now.Well, why\\'d you say six or seven rather than like a four?\", \"Yeah, looking ahead.\", \"You can\\'t keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.\", \"Okay.\", \"Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to, I think on that same scale from one to 10 Oh, wow.\", \"Okay, why do you say 10?\", \"okay, and so you mentioned, you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down.\", \"Have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that.So sort of Trying to plan more activities that don\\'t involve alcohol, and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you\\'re drinking.\", \"Okay.\", \"Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or ?Okay.\", \"So I guess we\\'ll talk about less alcohol activities.\", \"I\\'m just making some notes to myself and then maybe reducing the amount of drinking that you\\'re doing if alcohol is involved.\", \"Okay.Does that sound like something you\\'d like to do?Okay.\", \"Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school, and You know, becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician, you\\'re really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there.\", \"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol.\", \"And that, you know, there\\'s a lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much.\", \"So yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place.\", \"And as long as you\\'re willing and interested in meeting again, I\\'d be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it\\'s going.Alright, great, so I\\'ll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.Hi, Laura, thanks for coming in.\", \"So I\\'m not sure how much you know already about sort of what you\\'re doing here, if it\\'s okay, I\\'ll give you a little rundown.\", \"So basically, we\\'re here I\\'m just going to talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in.\", \"It\\'s not my job at all, to judge you or to try and change you, you know, basically, I\\'m going to talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that\\'s going to be most beneficial for you.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?\", \"And What kinds of things do you plan for your life?That\\'s great.\", \"Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go?\", \"Or?Oh,  Cool.\", \"So kind of keeping your options open.Great.\", \"And do you have an idea about what you might want to study?\", \"or?Oh, wow.\", \"Okay, that\\'s exciting.\", \"All right, cool.\", \"What do you like to do for fun?AhmmmLike to have a good time ?And you have a lot of friends or a few close people or?That\\'s a good way to be Right.All right.\", \"So it sounds like in general, your things are going pretty well for you.\", \"How are your grades right now?\", \"Okay, great.\", \"Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them.\", \"They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important.\", \"So I\\'m going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can look them are so there\\'s things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self determination, and spirituality.\", \"Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?Okay.\", \"What\\'s important to you about your family?Okay.\", \"You have brothers or sister ?Okay, great.\", \"And how about friendship ?Great.\", \"So being a good friend and having people who are good friends, too, is important.\", \"And then what about belonging?\", \"You mentioned that one too.Yeah.\", \"Not wanting to be part of a group.Okay, great.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, one of the things I want to talk about is, you know, you mentioned that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of thing.\", \"And I\\'m curious when you\\'re at the parties, do you ever have any alcohol?Okay, can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?okay, you\\'re kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for you to hold a drink Okay.\", \"And do you think that this is most weekends?\", \"Or occasionally How often do you think that you are take alchohalSo one or two weekends a month, You\\'re in a situation where there is alcohol?\", \"Okay.\", \"And what sort of situations are you in?So mainly just kind of hanging out with friends.Are you ever places where there are parents around or mostly just just with the kids ?And what about driving?Yeah.\", \"Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you\\'ve had alcohol?So that\\'s something that you sort of made a decision about.Okay, what do you know about how that\\'s dangerous?\", \"So you\\'re really trying to be safe and make sure that you\\'re not putting yourself into situations.That\\'s great.\", \"You know, it\\'s it\\'s tough to do sometimes.\", \"And I really commend you for being able to stick with that.\", \"So you mentioned you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two, what do you think\\'s the most alcohol you\\'ve ever had in one day?Okay.\", \"So the absolute mostOkay, and what kinds of things do you like about alcohol?Mm hmm.\", \"So it just kind of makes you feel relaxed.Okay.\", \"Anything else?Okay.\", \"And I mean, not so good things about alcohol?\", \"So you\\'ve seen a lot of other kids Yeah, had some consequences and decided that\\'s not for you.I got it.\", \"I can understand that.\", \"Any other things that you can think of?Okay, well, so, you know, as someone who\\'s not 21 yet, it is underage drinking is something that\\'s not legal, and it is something that is considered pretty risky.\", \"So I\\'m wondering what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life?So it\\'s kind of something that it\\'s just there.Okay.\", \"And I\\'m curious, you mentioned you know, your friends are important to you and your family\\'s important in sort of fitting in is important to you, and how does alcohol play a role with that?\", \"Okay.\", \"So from your family perspective, that Drinking is not something that fits very well.\", \"And with friends, you feel like it\\'s easier to to hang out with alcohol.\", \"Or maybe you wouldn\\'t have as much fun or your friends wouldn\\'t like you as much.OkayWell, when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward five years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?Okay.\", \"Can you expand on that a little bit more?\", \"What do you mean?Okay, so the alcohol, something that might make it harder to reach your goals?So when you\\'re sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say when you get to college ?\", \"Okay, so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually.how might that go?Yeah.\", \"So you don\\'t feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments?Okay.\", \"How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all important, not something you\\'re thinking about.\", \"And 10 is the most important thing, And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?Okay.\", \"So It is something you have thought about.And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?So what number do you think you\\'d say?YeahOkay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, kind of keeping that in mind.\", \"It sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments and you\\'re drinking at some point.\", \"And it\\'s moderately important to you.\", \"It\\'s something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself.\", \"And you actually feel very confident that you could be successful.\", \"With it, what sort of gold Do you think might be good to set for today?Okay.\", \"Do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?But what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?Uh huh.\", \"Anything else?Okay.\", \"So it\\'s, it sounds like you\\'re actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore, at least at the next party and seeing how it goes.Okay.\", \"Do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if working out for you.All right, great.\", \"And then it sounds like some of the benefits you\\'re expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.Okay.\", \"Well, very good.\", \"Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?\", \"Oh, that\\'s a great question.\", \"So a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back it\\'s harder if their friends are still drinking.\", \"And one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don\\'t involve alcohol.\", \"But of course, that\\'s harder if you\\'re not doing planning.\", \"So some of the things that can be useful if you\\'re at a party say, and there\\'s already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren\\'t your closest friends.\", \"Some of the things that I would recommend, since you\\'re interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.\", \"So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it.\", \"Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something.\", \"It kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there.\", \"Do you think any of those things might work for you?\", \"Okay.\", \"What about in terms of talking to your friends about it?\", \"Have you thought about how you might approach with them?\", \"Or is that something else you\\'d like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking?your friends would be pretty comfortable with that.Okay, great.\", \"Any other concerns or questions?\", \"Anything else?\", \"I go?Okay.\", \"So then, like I said, I\\'ll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it\\'s going.\", \"And then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together.\", \"Is that  Okay ?All right.\", \"Thanks so much.Lisa How doing today, I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"It\\'s nice to meet you.\", \"I\\'m glad you could come into the agency.\", \"Could you tell me what brings you here today?\", \"Um, well,All right.\", \"So you you ordered by a court?yeah.\", \"Mm hmm when?A month

money.How things stand between you and your friend now.No longer friends.\", \"All right.This day,remember doing it?\", \"Ah,How old are you in that happen?\", \"Remember?Will you ever treated for that, like, that type of mental health treatment?Are you aware of any diagnosis that you\\'ve been given related to mental health in the past?\", \"No, no.\", \"So you got into the sounds like a fairly serious fight when you were 12.\", \"And you\\'re 25 now can tell me what\\'s happened in terms of the other problems between 1215any other thefts or or assaults?\", \"Right?All right.\", \"And how much danger were the people that you were fighting?How many times did that happen to you seriously hurt somebodyCan you explain what happened?\", \"Like what what caused the fight?What are your feelings about that?Because of the way she looked at you, hmm.Do you ever have any feelings of guilt or remorse of that?Have you ever apologize to the people that were hurt?Also somebody situations, apologizing was kind of required.So you apologize to them that you didn\\'t really mean it.\", \"Oryou\\'re successful in getting into troubleYou say that kind of with a little pride is something to take pride in.Being able to travel.So that\\'s like something you look as like a skill that you have?Have you ever fought like the theft type activities you ever felt any guilt or remorse there?Kind of same thing,Were you ever the victim of a crime?Do you feel the trick good in working with people like in terms of social skills?So you\\'re effective at managing relationships to go to one?How would you describe your mood?\", \"Most of the timethough irritable.\", \"How often does that happen?Does that irritability ever lead to or has ever led to some of the aggressiveness?\", \"Yeah.What was the last time you were involved in a physical fight?About five years ago?\", \"Yeah.\", \"One type of things I\\'mso theYou have a job?Tell me about your work performance and experience there.You show up most of the time.We are.\", \"How is your employer described as employee.alright, so in terms of your feelings about missing work?\", \"How many jobs have you had?okay.\", \"Tell me about itWhat do you want to gain of treatment here?You\\'re in trouble now.\", \"And you\\'d like to get out trouble.Thank you.Hi, Laura.\", \"So thanks for coming in.\", \"I\\'m not sure how much you know about why you\\'re here what we\\'re supposed to talk about.\", \"So basically, I\\'m going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester, and we\\'re going to talk about you know, whatever\\'s kind of going on in your life.\", \"I\\'ll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you\\'d like to do for fun and those sorts of things.\", \"And then we\\'ll talk a little bit about you know, different behaviors and and stuff like that.\", \"So it\\'s pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you.\", \"Why don\\'t we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?Okay, and what do you like to do for fun?\", \"And when you and your friends are hanging out, where do you go ?Okay, and what kinds of hobbies do you have?\", \"So.\", \"Oh, cool.\", \"What are your plans for after high school?\", \"That\\'s great.\", \"What do you think you\\'ll Study ?Oh great, which is a little different.\", \"But yeah, that\\'s great.\", \"That\\'s a really good goal.\", \"It\\'s hard work to get into law school.\", \"Are you doing well in school?\", \"What kind of grades you get?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"What classes are you not getting A\\'s and B\\'s in?Oh, yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"And do you know where you\\'re going to apply to college?\", \"Okay, cool.\", \"And in what made you just add maybe last school or journalism?Okay, great.\", \"Sounds like you have like you said, really good goals and you\\'re working hard in school.\", \"You said that when you\\'re going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties.\", \"So, do you drink alcohol?Okay, And how often do you think you drink?So that\\'s actually kind of a lot of drinking then.Okay.\", \"What do you think\\'s the most you\\'ve ever had ?but you\\'ve been drunk before?Okay.\", \"So the most you\\'ve ever, ever had is two drinks in a day ?Okay, interesting.\", \"So do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?Okay.\", \"So one of the things that you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving.\", \"So you know, that\\'s actually a really big problem.\", \"And even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident.\", \"So that\\'s something that you really need to make sure you\\'re not doing.\", \"All right.\", \"Have you ever done that?\", \"Have you ever  ?Okay.\", \"How much do your friends drink?What about at these parties are going to Are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?And do you hang out with them ?So, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you in a lot more risk.\", \"Did you know that?\", \"Yeah.\", \"So there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking like, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, you know, will fall or, you know, break things, or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they\\'ve been drunk and fallen down or, you know, as a girl, it\\'s really important to that you\\'re careful because you could be sexually assaulted.\", \"You know, especially if you\\'ve been drinking then, you know, you\\'re at a lot more risk because the guy can take advantage of you.\", \"Have you thought about that?\", \"And then You know, people get in fights more often when they\\'ve been drinking to.\", \"Also, you know, there have been a lot of kids even at this school have gotten in trouble because they were drinking and so and took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or a school finds out and you know, we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy.\", \"Have you thought about that?But you\\'re still drinking?So, I mean, do you think it\\'s the thing to do if you want to be an attorney?Okay.\", \"Hmm.\", \"So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer.\", \"Obviously, you shouldn\\'t be drinking at all.\", \"What do you think about that?Mm hmm.\", \"So do you think you can quit?Okay, so I\\'m gonna write down then that you\\'ve decided to quit.\", \"And that\\'s going to be your goal.\", \"And that\\'s great.\", \"You know, that\\'s really why we\\'re here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision.\", \"So, I guess Can you quit this weekend then?\", \"Okay.\", \"And then what about your friends who are still drinking ?Okay, and what if they won\\'t?\", \"Yeah, probably if your friends won\\'t quit drinking, you should just find new friends.Because, you know, the problem is if they\\'re drinking, they\\'re gonna pressure you into drinking and then you\\'re gonna feel awkward and you know, you\\'re gonna be stuck and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them.\", \"If they if, if they\\'re the kind of people who are going to keep drinking, they\\'re probably not a good influence.\", \"And then then you\\'ll be better set for college too, because, you know, the issue is, you\\'re getting good grades now, but when you get to college, it\\'s a lot harder.\", \"And, you know, if you\\'re needing really good grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can\\'t be distracted by alcohol.Okay, so um, that\\'s great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you.\", \"Let\\'s see, I guess we didn\\'t talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking ?\", \"okay, so yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then.\", \"Okay, yeah.\", \"Okay, so, like I said, I\\'m gonna write down here that you\\'ve decided to quit.\", \"And you know, I\\'m gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that, you know, that\\'s still going well and you\\'re still not drinking and hanging out with any people who are drinking.\", \"Is there anything else you\\'d like to talk about while you\\'re here ?Okay.\", \"Any questions?Okay, you\\'re sure.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, that\\'s probably it then you can head back to class and thanks for coming in Hey Lewis How you doing today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"How things been going ?Last time we were talking.\", \"It sounds like you\\'re still having some difficulty with the quizzes.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"Is that still the case?Can you tell me about the process of taking the quizzes?\", \"I know we tested on a little bit before.So you\\'re looking down so you take these quizzes in class?like a paper pencil ?\", \"Okay, with other students around you.Alright, is the is having other students around distracting you ?So it\\'s, you\\'re pretty sure it\\'s the quiz itself and not some external.Okay.\", \"So it was paper and pencil you seated in the room.\", \"Rooms relatively distraction free.And you\\'re looking down at really the first item on the on the quiz and what\\'s happening?\", \"What\\'s happening that as you look down, you read that first item.\", \"What\\'s happening at a thought we\\'ll start a thought level What\\'s happening?\", \"What are you thinking?Okay, so your thought is that you\\'re going Gonna get, you\\'re gonna select the wrong response, and therefore get that quiz item.\", \"Wrong.\", \"How about behavior?\", \"Like, do you notice anything physically going on?\", \"As you\\'re thinking about that quiz item and how you\\'re going to get you calla little tense ?So it could be is that this thought of, I\\'m going to get this item wrong is leading to these uncomfortable feelings, the physical feelings.\", \"All right.\", \"So what happens when you answer item one, like you don\\'t know if you have a right or wrong immediately, right because it\\'s a paper and pencil.\", \"So you answer item one and you move on to item two.\", \"What happens then?So if you like it, because you because you thought that you got the first one wrong.\", \"That\\'s your chances again a cycle on one wrong actually increase.Okay.Have you ever had a quiz that you\\'ve taken where you were confident that you got the first item right?But eventually you\\'re going to come to one item that your doubts about ?right.There\\'s gonna be one that\\'s maybe a little more difficult or difficult for you.\", \"So it seems like what you\\'re saying is that when you reach that item where you have that thought, from from that point on the next item is, is more difficult because you\\'re having a similar thought Does that pattern continue?\", \"So explain to me what like, let\\'s just go with the example, the first item like, because just just to keep it more simple.\", \"So you have the first item.\", \"And that didn\\'t work out for that thought, right?\", \"The second one your thought was, I have even greater chance of missing.\", \"So what happens after you respond to that second item?That\\'s awful.\", \"So it\\'s an awful feeling for me.So by the time you get to item five or six ?Right.\", \"So that\\'s what\\'s on your mind.And how are those physical symptoms?\", \"Are they the same different or new symptoms ?So it really just gets mentally and physically more unpleasant for you.So when you just when you\\'re saying panic, the panics really occurring a few items in after you have the first one that you thought you\\'ve missed.And this has been happening for a while, as you described, right?Well, how about your grades?\", \"How have you actually been doing on the quizzes?Umm hmm.About your study habits if you consider yourself effective and studying ?Okay, so your study habits are good.\", \"And your quiz scores are good.\", \"But you\\'re still having these distressing thoughts and these uncomfortable physical sensations when you take the quizzes?\", \"Is that about right?So really, you don\\'t necessarily need your performance to change.\", \"You just you just need to your thoughts and feelings and behaviors to change.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So how you how you\\'re reacting to the quizzes maybe.And B is good.So Alright, so I want to take you back to the moment when you\\'re looking at the first slide.\", \"Let\\'s go back to that for a second.\", \"Okay.\", \"So you\\'re taking a quiz.\", \"And you\\'re having those thoughts surrounding the first item, which will not mistaken the automatic thought we talked about this right with cognitive behavioral therapy.\", \"Go on Mac thought is that I\\'m, I\\'m not going to get this one right.or something to that effect ?What does that mean to you?Alright So with that thought means to you is that you\\'re going to miss that item and then you\\'re going to miss all the rest of it.\", \"So you\\'re, you\\'re going to fail the whole quick whole thing.\", \"So looking at that, almost, let\\'s call that an intermediate belief, right?\", \"It\\'s more of a rule or an expectation, right?\", \"What does that mean to you?So just keep stacking other other beliefs.\", \"So you\\'re gonna fail the course.\", \"And we\\'re gonna fail the final rather than then the course.\", \"So a few failed the course.\", \"What does that mean to you ?You\\'re not going to graduate ?So we\\'ve moved from failing the quiz if we just look at the meaning, right?\", \"To fail on the final to fail on the course, and now to not graduating.\", \"So if you didn\\'t graduate, what would that mean to you?So your chosen location to be a teacher would be not possible.Right.\", \"So we go a step further and say, What would it mean to you if you couldn\\'t be a teacher?So if you were to phrase it, and kind of think back as we to the CBT techniques and the kind of conceptualization uncovered.\", \"If you\\'re to phrase as an if statement.\", \"What would you?\", \"What would you be if you couldn\\'t be a teacher?\", \"what that make you?I\\'m a person who didn\\'t make it.\", \"I\\'m a person who failed.\", \"So in a way, you\\'re saying, I\\'m a failure.\", \"Right.Is that close?So remember, we talked before about core beliefs, and how these core beliefs drive these intermediate beliefs which combined with situations like in your case, taking quizzes to form these automatic thoughts.\", \"so one of your core beliefs may be that, that you\\'re a failure.\", \"You may believe that.Does that seem like something that you\\'ve said to yourself before or thought before?Mmm hmmNot because it\\'s challenging or difficult, but something to do with you.\", \"Right.\", \"So that\\'s what I call like the you\\'re personalizing ?So you\\'re saying to yourself, at a variety of levels.\", \"I\\'m going to be unsuccessful?\", \"I\\'m going to....doe that make sense.\", \"Do you think that\\'s what\\'s happening?So you\\'re  able to focus and calm.well, So, somewhere, somewhere is this dis core belief?\", \"And it\\'s possible that it has something to do with you believing that you are a failure.\", \"unsuccessful?\", \"So they wouldn\\'t believe that you\\'re a failure ?you may believe it ?And similarly, if you had a classmate that was in the same situation, and and you know, struggled with these disturbing thoughts and feelings and behaviors during quizzes, how would you evaluate them?And you evaluate that they weren\\'t a failure.But If it was  yourself.\", \"You\\'re being a little more harsh.Which isn\\'t uncommon.\", \"So, there\\'s a few levels at which I think we can go after this.\", \"What I\\'ll call a problem, but really, it\\'s a series of thoughts and beliefs.\", \"Okay.\", \"The first is that the comic at the ground level, and that\\'s when you are taking the quiz.\", \"And you have that automatic thought that says, I\\'m going to miss this item.\", \"Yes, I\\'m not gonna get it right.\", \"So that\\'s your thought, I\\'m not going to get it right.And these situations, I like to encourage clients to apply what\\'s called an adaptive response or self talk.\", \"So it\\'s a it\\'s a noun.\", \"If you\\'re in a quiz in a quiet classroom, it wouldn\\'t literally be self taught.\", \"But it\\'s a thought that you were consciously applying.\", \"So the other thought that\\'s automatic,that just pops in your head, right.\", \"This one would be one that you deliberately thinkSo what could you think to yourself that would be a counter to that automatic thought that you\\'re having, that you\\'re gonna get that item wrong ?Okay, so just looking at the probabilities based on your past performance, even though I\\'m thinking I\\'m going to get it wrongChances are, I\\'m going to get it wrong,So you are getting most of them.\", \"Right.So I like that adaptive response.\", \"Right.\", \"Do you think that makes sense for you?I think you did well, there.\", \"So the next time you\\'re taking a quiz I want you to apply that adaptiv response.that this takes work.\", \"Right.\", \"So this automatic thoughts gonna come upon you.\", \"And then before you know it, you\\'re gonna have that feeling.\", \"physical symptoms.Discuss the sweaty palms.\", \"Right.\", \"And the feeling of I think you mentionedSo don\\'t let it discourage you those symptoms Come on so quickly.Right.\", \"There is an intervening thought and you\\'ve identified it.\", \"Right.\", \"So, you will have an opportunity, most likely to apply that automatic thought at some point.\", \"But the first few times it might be a little rough.\", \"I guess the nice thing about a quiz is, I mean, how many items are on these quizzes?\", \"So you have a few different chances to apply the adaptive responses.\", \"Right,Yeah.\", \"So you know, you\\'d like to get on the first time where you have that on I thought we identified on that thought, but if you don\\'t No big deal.\", \"Right?\", \"So, you know, later on maybe it takes them two or three.\", \"And then you might remember, hey, I have thisYeah.\", \"And my hope is that as you apply this adaptive response more and more, you can reduce the probability that that automatic thoughts going to come in.\", \"So that\\'s one level that I want you to, to go after it.\", \"Does that make sense?That\\'s how many feel like you could you could do at the other level, I guess you\\'d call this a deeper level, but it\\'s all really, you know, in your brain, right?\", \"It\\'s just this core belief.Okay.\", \"And why use the word deeper is because we think of core beliefs as more stubborn, but they don\\'t change as easily.as automatic thoughts might.\", \"I\\'d like you to and this is really just more selection, reflect on the evidence or evaluate the evidence that supports and refutes this idea that you were unsuccessful that you\\'re a failure.\", \"Right.\", \"I think cognitively, you kind of understand that you\\'re not.\", \"Right.\", \"But another sense, you feel like you are right.\", \"So in a way cognitively you\\'reRight.\", \"Right.\", \"There\\'s, there\\'s a little bit of both.\", \"you can tell me that, your family would say that\\'s not the case.\", \"But you stillThere\\'s a part of you that still feels that way.\", \"There\\'s a part of you that still believes that cognitively.\", \"There\\'s also a part of you that thinks through that says that\\'s that\\'s not accurate.So I want you to weigh the validity of that core belief.Right.\", \"And actually, I think that this is helpful to write down evidence that that would support it.\", \"Right.\", \"And that\\'s certainly something to note.\", \"But also, and this is really more important evidence that refutes it.\", \"evidence that runs counter, but record both, and we\\'ll meet next time and we\\'ll look at the evidence evaluated.So those two, those two steps you feel like you\\'re comfortable with and they make sense to you.When\\'s the next time you\\'ll be taking a quiz?next week?Okay, I know how these quizzes oftehn?\", \"All right.\", \"So we\\'ll set up a session for next week.\", \"Let\\'s try to get towards after your next quiz.So we\\'ll have that to talk about.\", \"I think that\\'s the next area to make.\", \"It sounds like the next area.\", \"It\\'d be good to try and make progress.Seems like that\\'s what you want to work on.So We\\'ll go from there.\", \"So I\\'ll set up an appointment for just to have that quiz.\", \"Tried to adapt the response and try evaluating evidence.\", \"Quickly.does that sound good ?All right.\", \"I will set the appointment up and I appreciate you coming in and working through this.Hi Jack, how are you doing today ?I am not doing bad, Thanks for asking.\", \"I\\'d like to give you an assessment to test your thinking and memory.\", \"Is that right?\", \"So I\\'ll be asking you a series of questions.\", \"If you could just

with the Adderall?.right, so, go aheadIt\\'s always available ?You\\'re having some mixed feelings about it.\", \"So I\\'m sensing.you think you think you want to stop?You do ?But at the same time it is in your life ?So you find you have easier access to the Adderall when you\\'re when you\\'re in the house or apartment with your, with your roommate.\", \"So if you physically weren\\'t there, like with your roommate in that apartment?So you\\'re kind of it sounds like you\\'re recognizing that, maybe you don\\'t have the willpower to stop taking the drug when it\\'s right there in front of you.So mostly so so there\\'s still some feelings for you.\", \"You want to use it, but mostly you would like to stop ?so there\\'s some advantages for you ?it\\'s comfortable and it allows you To be productive.\", \"Are there any downsides to it?So it\\'s painful ?And one of the ideas you\\'re having was sound like potentially was moving out, moving out of the apartment, because then you wouldn\\'t have access to the who would have access to the Adderall anymore?\", \"Or it would be hard to get ?You think you\\'re ready for that?And that moving out you really see is what you would need to do.\", \"Because stopping while living there is too difficult.Remember before you\\'ve tried to stop living there a few times right or, or last few months and with your roommate having it with your roommate being the one that gives it to you.\", \"It just appears that temptation so great for you.Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents?Okay, so humiliation would be one.So some clear disadvantages to move into Paris any advantages other than the obvious who would separate you from the  Adderall?Yeah.things that happened before ?So there\\'s some disadvantages to this plan, but there\\'s some advantages.\", \"And there\\'s a key advantage of being think of narrow.That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on.When you really think about it, what comes to mind?That\\'s right.\", \"It would be.Is it tough?Before it seemed like you\\'re really more on the side of making this change than not.\", \"Clearly, there\\'s still some things you want to consider.You always end up using the Adderall ?So, so make sure I understand the situation overall.\", \"You live with your roommate, she has that role and she makes it available to, you use it?You\\'ve tried to stop that behavior, but that\\'s just not working for you.You don\\'t want to be using it.\", \"But yet you are.\", \"Especially because the proximity, right, like cuz you\\'re right there and she has it and it\\'s just tougher to stop that behavior.\", \"There\\'s another possible decision, which is moving back home, which has some disadvantages and advantages.\", \"so that there\\'s an upside to it.That would be beyond just not using the drug which would which fit itself It\\'d be a big victory for you.So let\\'s do this.\", \"It seems like that\\'s the direction you\\'re moving.\", \"Right?No pun intended with moving.\", \"But that\\'s, you\\'re you, you\\'re thinking that might be a better way to go?So, for the next session, let\\'s plan out that and this wouldn\\'t necessarily be doing anything.\", \"This would just be let\\'s plan out the steps that you\\'d have to put in place to move out to move back home, talking to your parents, whatever financial arrangement, have the roommate, getting all your stuff out the logistics of moving, let\\'s just go through the steps.\", \"And try to get a firm plan together.\", \"And of course, you can always re evaluate and change your mind.\", \"But all we\\'re doing at this point, is just just planning and seeing how it would look.\", \"Exciting ?So I will see you and next week ?and we\\'ll pick up where we left off and we\\'ll, we\\'ll start with a planning and we\\'ll see what happens with that.\", \"Thanks.Hi How you doing it today.dude, okay.\", \"Yeah, I understand you\\'re here to receive counseling services.What\\'s going on with you and your boss?So who\\'s who\\'s calling you in flux for perfectionist?I\\'ve had several coworkers.\", \"There was a recent incident where somebody wanted to change days with me, but I told them the schedules that I\\'m supposed to be here on Wednesday.\", \"You can\\'t change it.\", \"That\\'s the it\\'s right there like a white.\", \"I work Wednesday, you can\\'t change that.And they didn\\'t do that.\", \"Instead, they asked us which dayIn what ways you get upset?Alright, so that upsets you.\", \"And that upset them that whole incident?\", \"Yes.\", \"Anything else that your boss may have as a reason forSo you need to self fairly well organized as employee.you mentioned you there from eight to five.\", \"and take your lunch from 12 to 1230.How many days in the last say, three months?\", \"Have you been late left early?So this is this is frustrating for you that your coworkers can understand where you\\'re coming from.Have you ever had to work in a, like a group like team with any of your coworkers?So, working in groups hasn\\'t worked out too well for you.So in instances where people listen to how have things worked out,Can you tell me anything about Sure.\", \"mood in general, in terms of Have you felt sad or anxious or anything like that recently?So if you\\'re, if your day is not going the way you planned for it to go, you\\'re feeling some anxiety from that.\", \"Absolutely.\", \"No.\", \"Does your employer ever have like, unscheduled meetings or anything like that that happensShe has some different stressors at work.So your home life\\'s a bit like your work life in terms of being organized.Do you ever in terms of your home life ever collect anything?Do keep them in your home.So what percentage of the receipts that you\\'re given Do you think that you keep all of themgonna ask you some some questions.\", \"Boom, come back to work, kind of regarding your work schedule.Do you ever find yourself like having washed your hands and then going back and washing them several other times?Do you have any particular concerns about germs or anything like that?Have you ever found yourself in a situation where touching something repeatedly like a doorknob or operating a light switch?\", \"Seems to lower your anxiety like repeatedly doing that?That\\'s that\\'d be inefficient.double checking, for example, light switches or to make sure the doors are locked.\", \"I madeso check but just the one timeSo what do you think the solution here is your your employer sent you in for counseling.\", \"Like the change,you like your job.Right?\", \"So you like your job you like how you able to be organized there.\", \"But there\\'s some conflict with co workers and your boss you want to you want to try to work that out.not to open to attending counseling sessions and take a look at what\\'s going on here.I want to appreciate you answering my questions and spin very helpful.\", \"We\\'ll get you on the schedule to see a counselor here.\", \"I take about a week and we\\'ll go from there.Thanks.Hi Ann, How are you doing today ?\", \"I\\'m well, thanks for asking.\", \"So you sau you doing okay, what\\'s going on?Umm hmmTell me about some of the foods that you\\'ve been eating that have been kind of leading to this problem for you.You\\'ve had a rough week ?So, let\\'s talk about for a second.\", \"I\\'d like to the kind of your relationship to this problem.\", \"How do you how do you view this problem?So the so the food is in control of this situation?It\\'s in control ?Alright.\", \"So, now I want to ask you a couple of questions about the importance and the confidence of changing clearly, you have some desire to change or we wouldn\\'t be be here.\", \"So if you\\'re looking at a scale of one to 10, one was, it\\'s not important to change and 10 was extremely important change.\", \"This is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating 10 times very important to you.very important.\", \"Okay.\", \"So what if I asked the same question except this time?\", \"You\\'re confidence.\", \"So, one is you\\'re not confident, all you can change, but 10 you\\'re very confident you could change.overall  yeahSo it\\'s below the below the scale of one to 10 this isso you can have no confidence at all.So, on one hand you\\'d like to, you\\'d like to stop the eating, It\\'s important to but on the other hand, you don\\'t believe you can do it.\", \"You can\\'t do it?it can\\'t be done.\", \"Have there been any other changes you have been able to make, say in the last few years that have been positive.So you had some small successes in terms of making changes.What do you think makes the this thought I\\'ll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful ?\", \"So much more difficult to tackle?The food is everywhere?You mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week.You enjoy chocolate?Okay.\", \"How about other foods that could be contributing the problem?\", \"Maybe you don\\'t enjoy as much as chocolate.Definitely any of the types of candies ?Pretty much any candy?So of the candy, so I want to focus just on the candies.\", \"Okay, and not to the foods just for now.\", \"The thought of like I introduced the idea of stopping eating chocolate.\", \"How would you react to that?\", \"That\\'s not gonna happen?\", \"All right,right, But that\\'s not gonna happen ?So you know that for sure.\", \"How about the let\\'s, let\\'s go, for example with the Skittles.\", \"What if I introduce the idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles?Just Just that one candy.\", \"Yeah.you could.\", \"It\\'s up to you whether or not but if I introduced that idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles, how would you react to that?Well, it represents a change in the direction that you want to move.we know we know that scenario that you know, you can\\'t really make a change right now from what you\\'re saying.\", \"Like that\\'s the idea of stuffing chocolate is not going over well, with youand that\\'s fine.\", \"But the idea of stopping Skittlesthat doesn\\'t seem as daunting?Would you agree still on, say the 110 scale that it\\'s important to stop Skittles?Okay.How confident are you you could not eat  ?So this is a change that you think you could accomplish.Even though you\\'re not sure it\\'ll actually contribute to solving the larger problem.\", \"We know that that\\'s something that that\\'s an area where you don\\'t really see a change as as likelyWell, I would hope it\\'s something that that you would want to do.\", \"I mean, what I want is one thing, what you want is really important here.\", \"Is this something that mean your Skittles, part of the problem?\", \"small?Alrigh.\", \"No pun intended, right.\", \"But it\\'s a small part of the problem, but you\\'d agree it\\'s still part of the problem.\", \"Not a huge change.\", \"But it\\'s one that we can work on.And we want you to be able to, you know, genuinely buy into the goal.\", \"I mean, if you don\\'t think it\\'s important, we can talk about other areas of change.right.\", \"You think you could stop eating Skittles, but you don\\'t think it\\'s gonna solve the larger problem or lead to?But that\\'s what we have to work with right now.\", \"Because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control.So if I introduced the idea of stopping brownies, So let\\'s let\\'s go after the change that we can achieve in this case.\", \"You know, it\\'s not perfect.\", \"It\\'s not ideal, but it\\'s what you can do.\", \"you saw the plan so suffer  so for this week so you can week for this week just Just continue eating Skittles.\", \"And let\\'s see, let\\'s see how we do with that change.Yeah.Thanks.Hi Kylie, How are you doing today?Not bad.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"What brings you in?So you came into therapy today?\", \"Because your girlfriend pressured you?so you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in ?and what she would like you to do, and this is her goal, not yours would be to stop smoking.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Tell me what your goal is?So do you have a goal of quitting smoking?Can you tell us some of the not so good things about smoking?So smoking, the way you\\'re presenting it, there\\'s been a positive thing in your life ?Are there any negative aspects to smoking?So you don\\'t seem like you\\'re too worried about the negative aspects ?So I wanna ask you a question.\", \"I want you to give a response between one and 10 as is called scaling And it\\'s to do with the importance of stopping smoking.\", \"So one would be, it\\'s not important to, and 10 would be, it\\'s extremely important to you, where do you think you\\'d put that number?\", \"So not particularly important?Now, let me ask you the same question except instead of importance, how confident are you about confidence?\", \"How confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale of one sound one being not confident all and 10 being extremely confident.So stopping smoking is not important to you, but you\\'re fairly confident you could if you decided to quit.\", \"So, based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn\\'t seem like you\\'re interested in stopping smoking, what would be a goal?\", \"How could we spend this time so that it would be productive?So to help her to understand why smoking works for you.That\\'s that\\'s one goal than any other goals you could think of I mean, you came in, in part because you\\'re well, that seemed to appear like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you.\", \"So any other relational goals you might want to work on there?So productive communication and productive argumentsSo so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend.She understands how important it is to youBecause it does seem like it\\'s really important to you.\", \"But another would be to work on your relation, your relational style, so that you, you can end argument and feel like you\\'re not at a stalemate?All right.\", \"Well, you want to make those two goals.\", \"We work one so we can spend this time going up too fast.\", \"Does that make sense to me.\", \"Well, that\\'s what we\\'ll do.\", \"So what I\\'d like to do, I\\'ll see you again and about a week.\", \"So if you could reflect on some of these changes you think you can make with this relationship where you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator.\", \"Because a lot of this revolves around communication.communicating the advantages of smoking, but also communicating in the arguing, so that you have productive end to these arguments, right.\", \"So it\\'s really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result.\", \"Okay.\", \"So if you could work on kind of thinking that through, and then next time we meet, we\\'ll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to to meet those goals.\", \"All right.\", \"Thanks for coming in Kylie.Hi Ann, how are you doing today ?About the same ?what was going on ?They might be starting to notice that you\\'re under the influence of the Percocet?Could before I remember when we talked, it seemed like you felt safe in that No one was gonna find you out.So in terms of concentrating, focusing?And this is tough for you.\", \"The Percocet makes you feel normal.\", \"I would talk about this before.\", \"Yeah, it used to give you high, but not anymore.But it makes you feel normal.And we\\'ve talked about the detox options.it\\'s not something that you want.\", \"So really, what\\'s changed to make things more difficult is that you\\'re worried that your coworkers are on to you.\", \"Right.\", \"And it\\'s your performance in terms of focusing on on your accounting work has been compromised as well.\", \"is that right ?And you\\'re afraid that\\'s going to be noticed as well?Alright.\", \"Let\\'s talk about I want to do some scaling work.\", \"I want to talk about the importance of this change to you know, cuz we\\'ve been talking about this change for a whileYeah.\", \"Let\\'s talk about, let\\'s just talk about the importance of it though.\", \"So just focus on that one narrow piece.\", \"Okay, we\\'re just we\\'re just talking about how important it is.\", \"So on a scale of one to 10, with one being not important at all, and 10 being extremely important.\", \"How important is it to you that you that you can make this change?\", \"Can you make this change?Well, so it\\'s important that you keep your job and that importance, in a sense now appears to be tied to the importance of not using Percocet.\", \"They\\'ve been tied together a little bit, right.So if you if you if you had to pick a number one to 10, or 10 is extremely important.\", \"How important is it to you to make the change?7 so fairly important.You have to keep it up?So let\\'s talk about another construct.\", \"That\\'s important.I want to talk about confidence.\", \"So using that same scale, how confident are you that you can beat the Percocet?About about six months now.So it was in the one to 10 scale.\", \"What do you think you would be?So very low confidence, nope really no confidence.\", \"You have no confidence.\", \"You have no confidence that you can change and it\\'s very important to you that you do change.\", \"So this is a real bind the trend.\", \"You mentioned that one of the reasons your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six months and working with me and you\\'ve not been successful at stopping the Percocet use.So it\\'s easy to see where the low confidence rating comes in.\", \"Based on your experiences the last six months.\", \"How about other times when you\\'ve been able to make a tough change?\", \"If you look through your, your past and different experiences, has there been any other occasions where you have been successful, beating something like this and making a tough change?So that was those tough that was.\", \"Would you say that you felt addicted to gambling?And it was painful to stop.\", \"Are you happy that you did stop?So when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling, right, how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then?So there\\'s some parallels here between what happened with the gambling and with what\\'s happening now the Percocet.So you would say you were successful at beating that addiction?Definitely success, so what happened?\", \"So the mechanism is different.\", \"Like for the gambling, you\\'d have to drive to the casino to drive Delaware Park.\", \"You\\'d have to have moneyWhereas the the percocets so easy.\", \"Yeah that you get them for my friends.And it\\'s a lot easier to consume and Percocet than to get in your car and make the time and so the mechanism is different.But wonder if there\\'s any similarities with this?\", \"Well, with the success and the potential success, meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling, you think that you could never get through detox?You husband was supportive?So as you reflect on your confidence, and this is not something you necessarily need to do right now.\", \"It\\'s probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past.\", \"All the circumstances were different.\", \"But you gained too high from that gambling.that was it was addictive?and and you beat it and it and it was hard it was challenging but you also have a supportive husband.\", \"Would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop Percocet?Well, since this since stopping is important to you, but your confidence is low.\", \"But this might be a good area to kind of process which is, you know, you do have the supports in place, and you have successfully defeated addiction before.\", \"So it\\'s something to consider, as you weigh, you know, I know that detox is something you\\'ve expressed really clearly that you\\'re not a big fan of and I can appreciate your reasons.\", \"At the same time, get support, you don\\'t lose your job.\", \"So, let\\'s do this.\", \"Let\\'s, between now and when I see you next, maybe reflect on some of the strengths and supports and the past successes you\\'ve had.\", \"And see if we can accurately factor those into this equation.\", \"Right as you\\'re processing through and and considering a very tough decision.\", \"So it makes sense?So we\\'ll pick up next week there.\", \"And I really appreciate you coming in today.Thanks, youHi Amy, I\\'m Denise I one of the advocates here, at the center and how are you?\", \"How are you today?Yeah, it\\'s something really different for you.Well, why don\\'t you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?So you\\'re, you\\'ve heard a little bit about the program here.\", \"Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what what my role might be today?What I want to reassure you of is that I\\'m not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or information at all.\", \"I\\'m here to help you in whatever way is useful to you to sort out what what\\'s going on and what if anything you\\'d like to do differently.\", \"So this is really up to you.\", \"What you would like to explore today, how does that sound?So right now you\\'re feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that\\'s going on, and you\\'re not even sure where to start.Yeah.\", \"So now anything any kind of decisions you make, or anything that you do affects both you and and the baby.\", \"Well, I if you\\'re interested or you\\'re willing, why don\\'t you tell me a little bit about your story?So the in the history of the relationship over this year, it\\'s kind of been in and out in a way and there have been Some incidents where you\\'ve had some arguments and then separated for a while and gotten back together but it does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out.\", \"All all of you the baby and you and him and, and was kind of scary.\", \"So in a way it doesn\\'t, it didn\\'t even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand, He\\'s really good.\", \"Good with you and good with the Father.\", \"I mean, good with your child.\", \"And on the other hand, it was just like, what is this something really different?What are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do if, if anything, what are what are you thinking about?\", \"gotten pretty isolated ?So you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and, and yet He, he doesn\\'t really he\\'s expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you.\", \"And, and when he\\'s there, he does take care of you.\", \"Does that leaves you in a real bind when you\\'re, you\\'re there and you don\\'t have what you need?So you\\'ve kind of find yourself when you\\'re in that bind, trying to find ways of, of getting getting what you need.I just want to say we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you.\", \"But I just want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate how hard this is to be able to talk about it.\", \"And it\\'s it\\'s not an easy situation, and you\\'re definitely not alone.\", \"And I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it.Yeah I know.\", \"There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are that that many women in very similar situations find themselves and things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and Figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be?And and some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship, you\\'ve mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it\\'s can be really good and, and then he can be gone for a while and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that.\", \"We can certainly talk about resources about the resources in the community that may be there for you, or in terms of your own understanding.\", \"But also if you if you are in need of additional help, we can talk about those.\", \"We can talk about safety planning.\", \"I mean, one of the one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and in your baby safe.\", \"And we can talk about that.\", \"We can talk about finances.\", \"You mentioned that you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now.\", \"We can certainly For that a little bit more, taking care of yourself which,Yeah, yeah, for many, many new new moms that\\'s hard under any circumstances to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy.\", \"So that\\'s certainly something we can talk about.\", \"And also just the whole issue about taking care of your child and, and your, your mothering your parenting, how you might, how you might focus on that and in this situation, or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front.\", \"Just to start with, what do you think?so maybe you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with what what it means and where it is.\", \"And now you\\'re kind of think well, maybe I think about some other things and see where I might go with those.so might be a way that focusing on how you might be able to take care of yourself get get a job or look at the possibility of doing that and the same time trying to incorporate you\\'re taking care of your child that those things might help you um Free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship?Yeah.\", \"You know, you\\'re the only one that that really will know about that about the dealing with the relationship about what, when the timing is right for any decision that you make one way or the other.Yeah.\", \"Well, and it sounds like you\\'d like to think about making some decisions in other areas.\", \"And, and when you think about that, is that right?\", \"Would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job?\", \"If that\\'s something you\\'d like to talk about?\", \"Well, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work when after the baby was born, what what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that?\", \"And and in thinking about thinking about that, what have you thought about?So you might have to explore some other options for the child care and in other ways of taking care of the baby so that you would be feel okay about going back to work?It really does sound, though, like you, you\\'re really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things the basic needs and really taking care of your child at the same time.\", \"RightLike being jealous, not wanting you to have friends?but it\\'s, we\\'ve mentioned that a couple times now that it that it sort of surprises you, the way you\\'re thinking about it in the way you\\'re approaching it.\", \"Like you\\'re recognizing we\\'re seeing that you\\'ve spent a lot of time really agonizing over over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship or what it really means you\\'ve spent a lot of time there.\", \"That kind of surprises you that you might be thinking about it differentlySo you\\'re realizing to how much it really takes to focus attention on on the baby.\", \"And to be able to Do it and it\\'s like I it\\'s hard to do both.\", \"It\\'s hard to really think about doing both.HmmWell, one of the things that we we look at is trying to help people who are in a situation similar to you where, where there might be some where there might be some fear about something that could that might happen, or you know, and I know you said he had indicated that he wouldn\\'t do it again.\", \"But sometimes it really helps people to feel to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe, if that\\'s what needs to happen.He just went farther this time?Yeah, yeah.\", \"And, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know, there might be places that you can go to get saved, there might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe or make sure that the baby\\'s safe for people to call or think just things that you can do based on what your life is like and what you what resources you have available to you.\", \"Is that something you\\'re interested in really exploring?Some ways it just seems like it shouldn\\'t have to be that way.really took you by surprise.\", \"It\\'s something that you\\'re just trying to figure out where, how does this fit and what it what does it mean?\", \"And what do I do with it?\", \"What what how do I how do I respond to this?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Well, let me see if I if I got it all and then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that.\", \"I want to make sure I understand a little bit about your situation.\", \"And this first of all, this is the first time you\\'ve come in.\", \"This is the first time that you\\'ve had something that really happened, this incident that happened where he pushed you really prompted you to to take some steps because it scared you and you you are wanting to protect yourself and your baby.\", \"You Really want to protect the baby, you have this relationship that\\'s been cut off and on and but he\\'s been very supportive and helpful in terms of giving you meeting your basic needs and the baby\\'s basic needs and wants to take care of you and, and there are times when it\\'s really good.\", \"And there are times when you\\'ve been less sure and this is this incident has also made you to kind of think about that some of the ways that you\\'ve been thinking about or thinking about it now kind of surprises you but you\\'re looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit so that you can have more financial independence, if you will, or be able to take care of yourself at the for those times when you need to.\", \"And you\\'re starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe.\", \"Did I kind of get it allYeah.Yeah.\", \"So maybe we can, we can take that next step in and when when when we get together again and we can do that we can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those in both of those areas for keeping yourself safe and, and for, you know, looking at the possibilities because there are options and resources out there should you choose to make the decision to go back to work, there are some options for you.There are other options for for a variety of things and we can make some have some discussions about that.Well, I really appreciate again, you\\'re coming in today, and we will follow up with this conversation and in it, you you will have it hopefully to give you what you needed to make any decisions that You need and again they are your decisions about what if anything you want to change and what your next step is.\", \"Yes, let\\'s make another appointment.Vanessa, Hi, nice to see you again.Yeah.\", \"How are you?Yeah, the last time we saw things were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the hot discharge from the house.\", \"for about a week ago,your how\\'s your injury?you even trying to stay fit.How are your kids doing?Imagine that there\\'s some you know, period of readjustment and healing and sadness or as in It sounds like also just trying to get things done.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"So here, you\\'re taking care of a lot of people, your community, your kids, all the while trying to take care of yourself.\", \"That\\'s a lot.\", \"I really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you you have going on.\", \"Well, you know, last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe.\", \"And I was wondering if you\\'d be interested in talking a little bit more about that today?\", \"Or perhaps if there\\'s something else that you would rather talk aboutSo, so you were scared.\", \"It sounds like you were scared.\", \"So so a lot of things were turned upside down.\", \"And when you say it was scary, I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive,So a lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing.\", \"\\'so say more about that say more about why you why you don\\'t want to call the police or you don\\'t want to get a restraining order.It sounds like that was a very scary experience in moment for you.And given that experience, you\\'re it sounds like you\\'re part you\\'re maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again.\", \"And that\\'s what you\\'d like to talk about today the alternatives to calling the police.Well, what have you thought about so far?\", \"What other ideas do you have about what you might do?\", \"In a serious moment where you\\'re scaredFor your your well being and that of your kids ?Okay.So, your minister, someone that you\\'re thinking about talking to a little bit about what\\'s going on in your relationship?\", \"What are your thoughts?\", \"What would you What would you say to your minister, what would you like to tell your minister?You feel like you\\'ve been keeping some significant information from your what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things, what might be some advantages or reasons to do that?it sounds like your pastors able to see him as a whole, complicated human being in the same ways that that you do perhaps  that there\\'s this side of him that\\'s scary and that you don\\'t like and then there\\'s this other aspect of him that you, you really do appreciate.\", \"And you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well.\", \"What would be another reason to talk to your pastor, in addition to this being someone you trust, and that Paul might listen to what would be another So so.\", \"So your pastor\\'s home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go?HmmSo you\\'ve said that a few times now that things got so out of control and crazy.\", \"Tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that was?Right.\", \"So so not only was it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children, but afterwards, it was scary as well, because of all the things thatYeah.\", \"So so.\", \"So going to your pastors talking to your pastor, possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantages.\", \"Are there any disadvantages, like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what\\'s been going on in your relationship?So this could really be a trigger a significant trigger?So that\\'s a little bit of a difficult situation.\", \"Yeah.\", \"As you think about this particular part of a safety plan, on the one hand, there\\'s potentially some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister.\", \"And at the same time, there\\'s this possible significant risk.\", \"When you think about, you know, the pros and the cons in this situation, what do you what do you make of that?\", \"What do you Where do you go with that?You\\'re, you\\'re really concerned.\", \"And a part of you is really worried about the next time.\", \"And you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning.\", \"And you also feel like it\\'s a risk that you\\'re, you\\'re willing to take given what is at stake.\", \"And really, it sounds like you feel like your life and your children\\'s lives maybe at stake.Would it be right with you if I offered just a suggestion or a thought something to think about in terms of kids and safety planning is something that I know other moms in a similar situation similar to yours have done and that is, sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a safe person to either call or run to in the moment When things are if, if things get really crazy and out of hand, I\\'d be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids.Yeah, you so you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violence situation, but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it without done.Yeah.\", \"And as he\\'s becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you, you\\'re also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe.\", \"And I\\'ve heard you identify a few things that you\\'re thinking about doing or would like to do.\", \"And things that you feel like you actually do have control over.\", \"Last time we talked to you, you were very clear about the fact that you can\\'t control Paul, when he\\'s in his fear and his rage and being violent.\", \"And what I\\'ve heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control.\", \"You can\\'t control him, but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to possibly a safe person, your minister.\", \"And having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and, and then the other pieces may be having a conversation with your oldest child, at least about who to call in the moment.\", \"And I confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I\\'m here to support you in any, any way that I can.\", \"And if it\\'s at all helpful, I\\'d be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more.Thanks for your time.So, good to see you again.\", \"Last week we\\'re talking about anxiety.\", \"Do you have your diary card?\", \"Okay, let\\'s look at it real quick.\", \"Bring it over here.Okay, so anxiety is really high.\", \"What happened yesterday anxiety is really high can be quick summarywhy?I knowThat\\'s scary.kind of explains that number.\", \"Hmm ?Well, I\\'d be anxious Of course.\", \"And it\\'s kind of scary to see that.\", \"And what else did you think when you saw that?And your family wants you to learn to drive this year because you\\'re 16And yet, you all you you keep complaining how you live in the middle of nowhere.\", \"And if you had a car you could like, go see friends more and get out of your lame Old Town and get to go do fun things.\", \"True.\", \"That\\'s true.\", \"And I won\\'t get to see you anymore.\", \"Because you\\'re dead.\", \"You know, I don\\'t treat dead people right.\", \"Remember that?\", \"Yeah, okay.\", \"So on one hand, I know the idea of driving is completely overwhelming.\", \"And I know you\\'re anxious, like all the time.so I\\'m wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things you\\'re talking about to help reduce your anxiety.\", \"Maybe that\\'s one idea to help you be able to get in the driver\\'s seat.\", \"What do you think?\", \"So, essentially, you\\'re practicing getting the driver seat by like doing this treatment and get in the driver\\'s seat of your anxiety, as opposed to being a passenger and you\\'re letting anxiety outside really your life?\", \"Because that\\'s what you\\'re doing.\", \"What do you think?I\\'m punning ain\\'t I?\", \"So, here\\'s an idea.\", \"Let\\'s get on board.\", \"We start treating this anxiety.\", \"We do it really, really good.\", \"job at it we work hard.\", \"And idea driving might not be quite as scary.\", \"And let\\'s face it being anxious driver increases your risk accidents.\", \"So reducing your anxiety, It\\'s gonna make you a safer driver.True.So here\\'s what\\'s interesting.\", \"You\\'re really good at being really anxious.\", \"So you\\'ll be really good at this.\", \"And it will go away.\", \"I promise you, I totally promise you.\", \"You know, done well, I\\'m the expert here of treating anxiety, and I promise you it will get better.\", \"I know everything.\", \"I know this.\", \"What do you think?All I do is totally, totally hard.I know.\", \"It isn\\'t.\", \"It\\'s pretty insane, isn\\'t it?\", \"I agree.\", \"Well, another option is you could just be anxious the rest of your life.\", \"Do they have a bus where you live?\", \"live with your parents for the rest of your life.\", \"I know I forgot.\", \"So you can live with your parents for the rest of your life.\", \"Because you\\'re too anxious to leave town you won\\'t be able to drive.\", \"So you could just live with your parents be anxious all the time, and you could go home so ideas on how to maintain your anxiety the rest of your life.\", \"You won\\'t need to learn to drive.\", \"I mean, your parents are fairly nice.\", \"They probably drive around for the rest of your life, you know, until they pass away or something.\", \"In the meantime, what about that?\", \"So forget the whole treatment.\", \"I\\'m pushing you too hard.\", \"Why don\\'t we just talk about how to maintain your anxiety?\", \"You\\'re good at it.\", \"It\\'s not meant to be funny.\", \"What do you think ?I really want to help you.\", \"I know being anxious every time Really hard.\", \"So one of the options is to really become good at being anxious, and do okay, and learn to sit with your anxiety.\", \"And another option is Yeah, getting more anxious to reduce your anxiety.\", \"Yeah.\", \"For your practice at it.All right.\", \"Do you want to review what some of the treatment strategies will be?Okay, let\\'s do that.Hi Kyle, How are doing today ?Not so good ?what\\'s been going on?Alright, so they\\'re at the point where anything else happens they discover it and you\\'re on the street.\", \"What are your feelings about being on the street?So there are conflicting feelings here.\", \"You don\\'t want to be out in the street.\", \"But you don\\'t want to give up the heroin same time.So you want to stop to avoid the consequences could happen.So this is the first consequence or potential consequences motivated you Right since you started usingHow strong is the craving to use?Right so when you when you try to cut back, have you tried to cut back?When you did try Did you have the feeling Were you getting sick?have your parents given you any options in terms of like Do they understand that your seems like you\\'re a little dependent onSo they have a solution in a sense for what\\'s going on.\", \"silica is like a detox.okay detox right.\", \"So they have a they have a solution to help get you off the heroin, but there\\'s still, there\\'s still a part of you that doesn\\'t want to go that route.Right.\", \"So there\\'s, there\\'s a few problems here.\", \"So So one is can you can you commit to going to detox and the second is, even if you successfully complete that, when you come back out, if you can build void the powerright.\", \"So you so really, you\\'re running into them as you walk to your girlfriend\\'s house.\", \"And he\\'s there and the temptations is great.\", \"Andin his house?know, feeling so so it\\'s exploiters.\", \"As soon as you\\'re walking up to the wall as you\\'re getting ready to pass this house Sumo like to all the way to your girlfriend, you divert to kind of go to his house and you have this feeling of excitement.\", \"What\\'s the thought that\\'s going through your mind?Okay, so you have a you have a few things going on.\", \"Do you think like, is your plan right now to go into the detox?let\\'s let\\'s presume for a second that the detox would be successful and you you wouldn\\'t be one even you wouldn\\'t be on heroin coming out of detox.Are you worried at that point that you\\'ll go right back?That\\'s that\\'s the point of worry right?so there\\'s there is a concern that you\\'ll you could, you could go back if you run into them?If you could stay away from him.\", \"You think you increase your chances of being successful?When you plans in terms of going into detox?okay.\", \"So it it actually sounds like what your parents have put in place you believe will work.\", \"Right?\", \"You have confidence that will work.\", \"And that your worry is what will you have is when you get out can you avoid it when your friendsYou don\\'t buy from anybody else other than your friends.So so that\\'s really becomes the maybe one of your key goals here since since your cake.\", \"Sounds like you\\'re committed to the detox part.\", \"Right and you know, some reading that incorrectly that that seems to be something you\\'reSo it\\'s it\\'s preparing for life after detoxand avoiding wait for the phrase people places things through with with the addictions or, or substance use.\", \"So in this case you need to avoid it would seem your friend we\\'re and and where he lives right which is unfortunately not far from you and in between because houses in between your house and your girlfriend so is there a way it\\'s may seem a little odd but there\\'s a way to walk around the block where you can completely avoid his house and still get to your girlfriend\\'s house.She would never even see his house.have other options as well.\", \"So there\\'s that option.\", \"How about her coming over to where your parents that was that ever happened before?because she can walk right by the house without problem,and to get to work, do you have to pass his house?So there\\'s kind of some like, really, there\\'s a physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here, which is just physically keeping you away from having to go by his house and sounds like the only reason other than to, to buy and use drugs is to see your girlfriend.\", \"There\\'s an alternative strategy here, right?\", \"She She comes to you, or you could go all the way around, and then only round back to return.\", \"And to get back and forth to work.\", \"You don\\'t have to go by his house at all.\", \"Is there ever a time where he comes to you?And we, you know, we know that there\\'s on my thoughts, we\\'ve talked about this before, right, that is on Mac thoughts that lead to feelings and behaviors.\", \"And can you identify a specific thought that may occur or maybe has occurred?\", \"Not really.\", \"walking by his house, but when you\\'ve been in your house like this, maybe it\\'s motivated you to go walk to his house,Okay,So you\\'ve identified a thought that that directly connects to the behavior you want, which is on board.\", \"So onboard leads to using the drug assuming because that would alleviate the boredom?Is there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment?\", \"When you say, board?\", \"Is there a depth of response to couplets as soon as this post detox.Sounds like that\\'s your plan.\", \"You\\'re sitting in your house detox is done.\", \"There\\'s no more you know, we would hope withdrawal type symptomsThe thought comes upon you I\\'m bored.\", \"What\\'s It\\'s a self talk piece that could be interjected there.So to the adaptive responses, call you girlfriend.On board and, and she, you know, sounds like what\\'s voice that she\\'s really supportive of?It seems like consequences motivates you.\", \"Right.\", \"And that\\'s what brought you in today like to practice anyway.\", \"So I\\'m wondering if another adapter response response could involve, you know, I don\\'t want any, any trouble.\", \"You know, and you can substitute a lot of words in for trouble.\", \"There\\'s all kinds of trouble that can occur from using heroin,So getting kicked out of house, I don\\'t want to, you know, I don\\'t want to get kicked out my house.\", \"I\\'m clean.\", \"And there\\'s something else I can do here other than drugs, Like I\\'m thinking in times and your girlfriend might not be around.\", \"Okay.\", \"Right.\", \"So you still want to have you want to have adaptive response.\", \"That\\'s not necessarily tied to a person in case she isn\\'t around.can use that one certainly, that\\'s a good one, when she\\'s not around.\", \"And you kind of revisit those consequences, new adaptive response.\", \"Do you think that\\'s going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house?Good, good.\", \"So it sounds like you have some some adaptive responses to use.\", \"Nothing occurs to me is your parents around muchAnd night one of the times and you have gone over to your friend\\'s house, So she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving the house, but only when she\\'s there.\", \"And similar to your father, you know, so it\\'s really, I guess we kind of narrow it down to when you\\'re home alone and particularly when your girlfriend\\'s not available, that\\'s your highest risk time right?\", \"So we have the cognitive adaptive responses to come employment, what was anything more behavioral, we can do like can you can you go somewhere else?I think that\\'s a good I think it\\'s a good plan.\", \"Yeah.\", \"and remember that the more we apply these adaptive responses, right, what we hope is that you the risk decreases, like your craving decreases your motivation to stay clean increasesSo while it may be only convenient to drive someplace, every time no one\\'s available, and you\\'d have thought that might not be something I do forever.\", \"But that\\'ll That\\'ll minimize the risk for now.\", \"And we want to, we want to focus on the short term first.\", \"And then we\\'ll worry more about the midterm and long termThen circumstances may change, maybe you he reside there forever.\", \"Maybe some of his work schedule change.\", \"Maybe there are other adaptations you can make.\", \"But But for now, I think this would be a good way to go.\", \"Just keeping you away from the circumstance, You definitely don\\'t want,So good news, a few behavioral pieces we have in here and then a few cognitive as well.\", \"So I want to see in a couple of days before we go into detoxso that we can practice some of these adaptive responses are like good practice some at home.\", \"Between now right as well.and these behavioral responses as well.\", \"But we\\'ll try to get them shored up before detox and I\\'ll see it right after you come out as well.We\\'ll make sure that we just keep working on applying and refining his adaptive cognitive responses and his adaptive behavioral responses.\", \"Right.\", \"Does that sound like a plan?I appreciate you coming in Jesse, and I\\'ll see you in a couple days.\", \"Thanks.Hi Hazel, how are you doing today?\", \"What\\'s been going on?in the bathroom?probably didn\\'t catch the person?So he\\'s still out in the community, right?\", \"So how is it affecting your your daily life?\", \"Can you tell me kind of what your where you\\'ve been feeling?Okay, so anxious and aware,RightSo you have covered a lot of ground there.\", \"So you have the you have the feeling of being like worried nervous, whether that\\'s gonna happen to you.\", \"But you\\'ve also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change routine to feel safer.\", \"has that helped has has changed in the way you dressed or changing where you go and when you go is that help reduce the anxiety?You mentioned specifically your husband has, like what\\'s been going on here?\", \"They areHave you taken any precautions because of this persistent worry.I was already mentioned like with the camera specifically.\", \"I mean,and that seems reasonable.\", \"Once you take reasonable precautions to try to avoid being video recorded, against your will.But still, you have this feeling of worry anxiety and your your schedules being interfered with?skewed you\\'d like to cope more effectively with your feelings, reduces anxiety.\", \"So when you enter into a public bathroom and we talked about automatic thoughts before those thoughts it just kind of pop into our head and they connect to feelings.\", \"That can be unpleasantLike anxiety and worry.\", \"So when you walk into a public restroom, what\\'s the first thing that goes through your mind?Okay, so when you walk in, you\\'re wondering if there\\'s a camera there.\", \"And when that automatic thought occurs, what follows that in terms of a feeling or behavior?So you behaviors looking for the camera or sometimes just leaving without using a restroom.\", \"And you\\'re You\\'re feeling is that that anxiety worry there?we\\'ve been talking about.\", \"Okay.\", \"So, really, if we think about, we talked before about the core beliefs, intermediate beliefs, and wonder if the intermediate belief, isn\\'t it, I\\'m vulnerable.\", \"Or this more specifically, maybe it\\'s more of a core belief.\", \"More specifically, I\\'m vulnerable in this area, like put this guy on the looseyou know, committed that crime.\", \"And then, you know, that\\'s combining with situations that you encounter, and that\\'s where you\\'re getting those automatic thoughts.\", \"So that sort of makes sense.Okay.\", \"So you remember what, what in terms of kind of therapy, you\\'d like to apply what we call the adaptive response or self talk.\", \"So it\\'s that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you\\'re having an automatic thought, that\\'s going to be to in this case, anxiety and worry and behaviors that are looking for the camera isn\\'t maybe useful behavior, but leaving, you know, that\\'s that that could certainly be on useful behavior.\", \"So in terms of that self talk, let\\'s let\\'s work to develop a self talk response so that you could tell yourself to that initial, you know, I wonder if there\\'s a camera in this bathroom.\", \"Right?\", \"What do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and the feelings you\\'re having?Umm hmmBut it\\'s good.\", \"So you have, you have a low probability of it happening, and you\\'re taking useful behaviors to minimize your risk even further.\", \"Right.\", \"So that\\'s a good automatic thought, I think are good adaptive response for the next thought rather.\", \"Why don\\'t you Why don\\'t you try that one out?\", \"Right, the next time.\", \"You had that on that thought?\", \"Right.\", \"Try out that.\", \"You know, I think that\\'s really, you know, that\\'s logical.\", \"I mean, it\\'s, it\\'s unlikely to happen.\", \"Of course, there\\'s a chance.\", \"Right,And we, we acknowledge that in the self talk, there\\'s a chance that it could happen, but there\\'s precautions you can take.\", \"That\\'s a low chance sometimes as well, so keep that on Mac thought.\", \"We\\'ll review it In the end, right before you leave today, we\\'ll write these down.\", \"But that\\'s that\\'s one adaptive response rather that I want to write down for you.\", \"I also want to talk about like, the worst case scenario, because right now you have the anxiety worry about an event that while it\\'s unlikely it could happen.\", \"It could happen.\", \"And I\\'m wondering how you think you would react?\", \"If it is the worst did happen if you if you use the restroom, and you found out through law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had been, you know, watching you right on recording.\", \"How would react to that?And it would make sense to feel upset.\", \"But that would be upsetting for anybody.\", \"But as you noted, that would probably be relatively temporary.\", \"distress, right?\", \"Well, acute, and certainly, you wouldn\\'t be happy about it.\", \"It shouldn\\'t be happy about it.\", \"It would probably go away.\", \"I learned to adapt.\", \"How long have you been in the state of anxiety and worry?And how many days and the average week are you affected by these feelings?every day?So if we can compare it right, we have a chance to be recorded, right illegally.\", \"That\\'s a low probability event.\", \"It could happen.\", \"Probably not likely.\", \"The anxiety and worry that you\\'re having.\", \"That\\'s a high probability event because you\\'re suffering from every day.So there\\'s a, there\\'s a point at which maybe you reach and you say, I\\'d rather take that route to take the risk, I\\'d rather deal with the potential consequences of that an unlikely event to be recorded and face that if it happens, then be in the state of anxiety, worryNow you\\'re suffering, right?\", \"And if, if you could adaptively respond effectively, you you\\'re still gonna have that risk of being recorded.\", \"But you know, you could survive that event if it happened late.And you\\'re taking reasonable cautions and you know, things we talked about.\", \"So, as you think about this in a more general sense, is there a adaptive response, you could apply it to that, to that on that thought of, you know, I need to be worried about This or, you know, whatever that thought looks like sometimes the thoughts in image rights may like an image have been recorded, but whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are that are getting you anxious or worried before you even get out of the house.\", \"What adapter response?\", \"Could you apply there?probably most areThat\\'s great.\", \"That\\'s a great adaptive Yeah.\", \"And actually, that\\'s kind of a few adaptive responses.\", \"But that\\'s good.\", \"And you can you can apply them and we\\'ll, we\\'ll kind of break them down.\", \"Like I said, before you leave today, we\\'ll break those down.\", \"So you can, you could have written down as you go out.\", \"I think it\\'s important, because the automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly.\", \"It\\'s important to rehearse these adaptive responses.\", \"So we\\'re ready to go.\", \"Right.\", \"And, and kind of, you know, we\\'re being we\\'re preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response.\", \"And in order to be prepared you, you have to know what it is.\", \"So it\\'s good to have it written down to kind of more or less commit to memory.\", \"Does that make sense?All right.\", \"So, before we leave today, I\\'ll take care of that.\", \"And I want you to use as adaptive responses for this week.\", \"I\\'ll see you next week.\", \"And record what the outcome Was every time you\\'re able to apply the response, and that includes what you felt and what you actually did.\", \"And of course, as you mentioned, any physiological reactions like your heart racing, right underneath that, so that\\'s really that sub behavior.\", \"But note both a physiological behaviors and other behaviors.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Once you\\'re consciously controlling, and then any feelings, okay?\", \"And we\\'ll go through them.\", \"We\\'ll go through each time use it one by one, they have a there are and kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it\\'s working.\", \"Okay.\", \"That\\'s the plan.So we\\'ll go from there.\", \"And I appreciate you coming in today.Thanks.Hey Michelle, how are you doing today?stressed?What kind of test?Now, that\\'s a job that you\\'ve been interested in for a while.so you know the material on this test pretty well?But the feelings and that the physiological response to heart rate and sweating, that feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses they got in the way of you completing it, like you were unable to complete it.So you weren\\'t you weren\\'t feeling great about taking the test in the first place?But did you know that was coming?you did ?Okay.So you had some anxiety in advance?or no, you did.\", \"Okay.erupt in that moment, and that prevented you.\", \"What do you think is leading to this?And since that this was third grade.And since that bad testing experience.\", \"Have you had trouble with tests since?Alright, so in third and third grade, you had a really bad testing experience.\", \"And as you move forward from there, you\\'ve never really been thrilled about taking tests But you\\'ve been able to adapt.\", \"You\\'ve been able to take them and still, like pass them.So that\\'s, that\\'s good, right?\", \"But this particular test, which is not for scorches for work, yeah, this one, this is more of a stumbling block for you.You have any ideas as to what may what may be what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you?So it really that same feeling you\\'ve had in third grade.\", \"That\\'s coming up with this test.And the other test you take in throughout the rest of grade school in high school they didn\\'t, they didn\\'t have that same value attached to them.you could, you could take them again or take the course again or?so you have you maybe had more options in school?Right, So it\\'s the, it\\'s the pressure is the pressure of you need to get through this.\", \"And you don\\'t have the safety nets that you had in school?\", \"So this a lot of pressure.So is there any time limit to this test for work?There\\'s no time.How many Is it like a, like a multiple choice?\", \"Okay.\", \"And you seem like, like you said, you said the night before with your friend.\", \"You\\'re really well prepared for it.So I have a few a few thoughts about this.\", \"One is I\\'m wondering you know, we\\'ve talked before about cognitive therapy core beliefs.\", \"So I\\'m curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating.\", \"For you now with this with this test, this work testsomething like, I am a failure or I\\'m bound to be a failure, I\\'m destined to be a failure.\", \"Okay, so  destined to be failure.\", \"So that, so that, potentially, is a core belief.\", \"Right?\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s operating.Okay, so it could be a core belief, but it\\'s also seems like you\\'re still on that thought.\", \"Like as you get ready to take that test.\", \"You\\'re thinking I\\'m just destined to be a failure.\", \"And you\\'re having what sounds like a panic response to heart racing.Are you in the room alone?\", \"You\\'re taking the test?you are.\", \"So no one\\'s really seeing you have this.\", \"I wouldn\\'t want to call it a panic attack yet we haven\\'t really gotten too far into it.\", \"But it sounds like it has some panic like features.Because it\\'s not.\", \"It\\'s interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the items.\", \"So, okay.\", \"So one thought I have is you have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like this?, the third grade thing?And what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increases and You have any other physiological symptoms wouldhmmmSo one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response.\", \"Right?\", \"So, which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk, I wonder if your doctor response couldn\\'t be I can ride this out like you have no time to test?\", \"I mean, the panic responses only maintained for so longto get some in a sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like, answering those right you know, you\\'re closer to achieving your goalSo the more items you you answer correctly, the less anxious you\\'re gonna feel because you\\'re closer to the end of.So that\\'s so that\\'s one well, that\\'s a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right?\", \"Like you can you can wait out the panic.\", \"I mean, you\\'re in the room alone.Yeah.\", \"Now the panic painful.\", \"Right, the you know, the panic symptoms are painful.\", \"So what you could tell yourself is, this isn\\'t pleasant.\", \"But I can write out these symptoms because they only last so long.\", \"Exactly.\", \"Yeah, because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know, five minutes.\", \"10 minutes, 15 minutes.\", \"But you have no time limit?\", \"yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, you could get right.\", \"And kind of, at the same time be telling yourself I can ride this out.So if that\\'s worked for you that ?So that\\'s, that\\'s certainly that\\'s certainly one adaptive response to try writing.\", \"Another one could be that, although it wouldn\\'t be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year.\", \"Right.\", \"You could try it.\", \"I mean, I know that\\'s not what you want, but, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that\\'s not working.\", \"Right.\", \"The I\\'m I\\'m Destin, that was the word right like I\\'m destined to be a failure.\", \"We know that\\'s not working for you.\", \"Yeah, you just have, you just have another years of study, right?\", \"And, of course, you wouldn\\'t have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome, I know you don\\'t want.\", \"But it\\'s not the end of your career, It\\'s not like something so drastic it\\'s important to you and I can appreciate that.\", \"But it\\'s not the end of your career.\", \"You\\'re not going to be unemployed.So that\\'s great.\", \"That\\'s another adaptive response, which you\\'ve survived this before.So this one event, I mean, I had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you don\\'t want that this kind of fashion.\", \"While use your word, your destiny by like this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic like symptoms.\", \"And fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again.\", \"And, and I met you know, so you have I imagine you could you can write out these, these symptoms.\", \"And I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I\\'ve been successful this before.Oh, it\\'s so good, when you have to take the test?So let\\'s schedule one more appointment right before that.And we\\'ll, we\\'ll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you\\'re ready to go.\", \"Okay.\", \"And really will kind of focus on the positive outcome.\", \"Right.\", \"Okay, which is just taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you\\'re having, and fighting through the useful thoughts.Great.\", \"So, Michelle, I\\'ll see you.\", \"I\\'ll see you then and work through it.\", \"I really appreciate you coming in today.Sometimes when people are feeling sad, they have thoughts of wanting to hurt themselves.\", \"If you had ever had any of those thoughts,Have you ever hurt yourself?Have you ever cut deep enough so that you needed stitches?or had to go to the hospital?Does anyone know that you know what you and I say is confidential but when I\\'m worried about people\\'s safety, and usually I need to tell someone about it.\", \"Because it\\'s so that they stay safe.\", \"But I wonder if we talk about you cutting a little bit more and help understand it.\", \"If you and I can tell someone in your family together so that when you feel like cutting, they can help you.\", \"And so you don\\'t cut anymore.\", \"Can you tell me about those thoughts?at some pretty rough.Is it is it all the time that you want to do it?\", \"I just some of the time, Some people say that when they cut themselves, it makes them feel and that helps them because they just feel nothing otherwise it\\'s not you.\", \"Okay.\", \"Have you ever had thoughts of wanting to kill yourself or in your life?Have you ever put a pillow over your face to try to kill yourself?You got scared?\", \"What kept you from doing it?\", \"Let me just stop.I wonder Victor, if we made a plan of what to do when you\\'re feeling like wanting to hurt yourself or kill yourself if we made a plan with your sisters here today?\", \"So if we made a plan with your sister of what to do, so that you go to your sister if you\\'re feeling sad, and you have a list of what to do when you feel like you want to die or hurt yourself, so you don\\'t hurt yourself.\", \"Hi, Victor I\\'m Dr.\", \"Sawyer.\", \"Victor, can you tell me how old you are?You\\'re 20 Okay, where do you live?you live at home?\", \"Who do you live with?Okay, so you live with mom, dad and sister.\", \"what do you do for work?Okay, so you came to me.\", \"It\\'s See me cuz I\\'m a Doctor.\", \"Okay, are your mom dad and sister here?Okay, so I\\'ll I\\'ll let you go back to them in a few minutes.\", \"But let\\'s just get through a few questionsSo Victor, tell me, how\\'s your sleep?\", \"And what about Have you experiencing any lack of joy?\", \"You need to calm down, victory stay in your seat.\", \"I\\'m gonna have to call security.you are you yelling at me right now and I need you not to yell.\", \"Are you on any medications right now?yes or no.\", \"Are you on any medications?okay.\", \"I need you to bring me a list of your medications later.\", \"So I\\'m going to give you a prescription for an antidepressant medication.\", \"Are you bringing home to your mom and show it to her and then get it filled?Okay, so I\\'m just I\\'m just gonna go to my computer and put it in and then I\\'ll be a receptionist will put you off the medication.\", \"Okay, so good luck Victor.Hi Victor, I\\'m Dr.\", \"Sawyer.\", \"Hi.\", \"I\\'m a psychiatrist.\", \"Do you know what a psychiatrist is?\", \"Okay.\", \"So a psychiatrist is a doctor who deals with people who are feeling sad or mad, different feelings that they might have.\", \"We\\'ll talk for a little bit and we\\'ll talk about some things that might have been difficult in your life over the past little bit.\", \"And our goal is to try to make things see how we can make things a little bit easier for you.So you feel pretty unheard.so you said you\\'ve been feeling pretty sad.\", \"How long have you been feeling sad for ?How long have you had this teacher for?So have you been feeling sad for this entire four years or a shorter period of time?So has it been a couple of weeks?\", \"A couple months?\", \"A couple days?So Victor, I want to tell you some of my thoughts of what I think is going on, but I want to invite your sister in because I need to find out a little bit about your medical history.\", \"So I\\'m just going to get her and then I\\'ll come back.\", \"Okay.\", \"So, I\\'ve been talking to Victor he\\'s been telling me about how his how he\\'s had less interest in things.\", \"He\\'s having trouble sleeping.\", \"And he\\'s, he\\'s not he\\'s feeling sad all the time.\", \"And it does sound like he\\'s been suffering from what we call a major depression.\", \"There\\'s a couple of treatments that I want to talk about what you know what medications Victor\\'s on?\", \"Thank you.\", \"Okay, so on this list it says about sort of what medical illnesses he\\'s had and hospitalizations and surgeries as well.\", \"So there\\'s a couple of treatments for for depression.\", \"One is medication and one is also doing some interventions within the school and within the family.\", \"And there\\'s a lot of things to think about, but it seems like things in the school have been really not going well.\", \"And that\\'s been a major contribution to his to sadness.Hi Susan, how are you doing today?\", \"I am doing well, thanks for asking.\", \"I want to give you a brief assessment to help measure functions like memory and thinking.\", \"Is that okay with you?\", \"All right.\", \"For the first part of this assessment, we\\'re going to be handing the sheet back and forth.\", \"Okay, I have a table there, so you can write on it.\", \"half a second part.\", \"I\\'ll get that out of your way.\", \"I\\'ll work on some other parts of it.\", \"Okay, that sounds good?All right.\", \"So let\\'s take a look at this section right here.\", \"I have my finger pointed, please draw a line going from a number to a letter in ascending order.\", \"So I want you to begin here and draw a line from one that\\'s a than the two and so on and here?thank you.\", \"I want you to copy this drawing as accurately as you can in the space below.Thank you.\", \"So in this empty space here like to draw a clock, put in all the numbers and set the time to five past hourThank you for joining us.\", \"Can you tell me the name of this animal?what the name of this animal?and the name of that animal?Thank you.\", \"This is a memory test.\", \"I\\'m going to read a list of words that you will have to remember now, and later on, listen carefully.\", \"When I\\'m through, tell me as many words as you can remember, it does not matter in what order you said.\", \"Truck, Banana, Violin, Born, Green.Thank you.\", \"I\\'m going to read the same list for a second time.\", \"Try to remember and tell me as many words as you can including words you said the first time.\", \"Truck, Banana, Violin,  Born, GreenThank you.\", \"I will ask you to recall those words again at the end of the test.\", \"I am going to say some numbers when I\\'m through, repeat them to me exactly as I\\'ve said them...3 2 9 6 5 Thank you.\", \"Now I\\'m going to say some more numbers, but when I\\'m through, you must repeat them to me in the backwards order.\", \"8 5 2 Thank you.\", \"Now I asked you to count by subtracting seven from 90 and then keep subtracting seven from your answer until I tell you to stop.correctthat\\'s good.\", \"Thank you.\", \"I\\'m going to read you a sentence, repeat it after me, exactly as I say it.\", \"A bird can fly into closed windows when it\\'s dark and windy.\", \"Thank you.\", \"Now I\\'m going to read you another sentence repeat it after me exactly as I say it.\", \"The caring grandmother sent groceries over a week ago.Thank you.\", \"Tell me as many words as you can think of the beginning with a certain letter of the alphabet, that I will tell you in a moment.\", \"You can say, any kind of word you want except for proper nouns, like Bob or Boston, numbers, or words that begin with the same sound, but have a different suffix for example, love lover loving.\", \"I will tell you to stop after one minute.\", \"Are you ready?Now tell me as many words as you can think of the begin with the letter S?Tell me how a carrot and a potato are like?Can you tell me how a diamond and Ruby are like?I read some words to you earlier, which I asked you to remember.\", \"Tell me as many of those words as you can remember,Can you tell me today\\'s date?tell me what day of week it is ?Tell me what place we\\'re in right now.and what city we\\'re in ?Susan, thank you very well.\", \"Hi Jill, How ar your doing today ?doing all right?a little better and even down for a while what\\'s going on?This is unusual for you because usually, when I come in, you come in and talk to me cut down or depressed, something changed recently.Can you tell me about the solution you found for your question?You want to commit suicide?\", \"You know how you\\'d do that?When do you plan on doing this?What kind of things to to arrange?So Jill, you\\'ve been seeing me for almost a year now and you know, by telling me this, that I\\'m gonna act to stop you.\", \"But I\\'m gonna try to stop you from killing yourself.\", \"You seem pretty serious, though, about your timetable in your plan.Is there anything that can stop you?Do you feel like it\\'s the depression or something else that drove you to this decision?as you said, it\\'s a solution.\", \"I know we\\'ve, we\\'ve talked about this issue in the past, right?\", \"And when you\\'ve come in feeling this way, kind of resolved harming yourself.\", \"We sent you over to the hospital.\", \"I know that\\'s not your favorite place.\", \"But when you go there for however long it\\'s been usually what five days come out feeling a lot better.\", \"Do you feel like this time would be different?So like I say, a part of you saying that.\", \"You don\\'t want me to stop you.\", \"But yeah, you came in here and you told me, so part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure.hasn it helped you gaining clarity?mean a suicide?Sometimes and you know, you\\'ve been with me, like I said about almost a year now and you\\'ve been depressed much that time.\", \"And it\\'s not unusual.\", \"When somebody thinks they found a solution to depression, even if that solution something that I am against, like suicide, that their their mood would become elevated because you see an end to pain.\", \"There\\'s other things we can do and have done the past, try to get you out of pain.\", \"But I\\'m not going to it\\'s my obligation with it I\\'m happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive.\", \"I\\'ve seen you this way before and I know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from a suicidal thoughts and feelings you did well for weeks, sometimes months at a time.\", \"You\\'re seeing really just the darkest when you\\'re in the Temporarily, because you feel you found the end to the pain which I understand.\", \"I mean, Understand you feeling better, but you\\'re feeling better because you plan on killing yourself.\", \"And we\\'ve talked about how devastating that would be to your family, right?\", \"your friends.So your logic is that if you end your life, you\\'ll freed them from having to deal withAnd as you know, I mean, you\\'ve signed releases, I\\'ve talked to your husband, your parents, they\\'ve repeatedly said that, despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression, they would much rather Have you alive, Why would they say that?So they\\'ll feel good over the grief?I understand.You know, I\\'ve been doing this for a while.\", \"Right.\", \"I think we\\'ve come to have a good relationship.\", \"And I would hope that I\\'ve earned your trust and you value my opinion.\", \"We\\'ll do something that I know about suicide.\", \"You open  to hearing it?There\\'s a lot of ways that people die.\", \"Right.\", \"And it\\'s, it\\'s really what eventually will happen to us all.\", \"It\\'s hard for me to imagine way more devastating than suicide.\", \"Meaning when somebody dies of an illness, or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident, people grieve, right?\", \"But there\\'s usually not a blame assigned to that mean they don\\'t feel guilty.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"They feel sad because they\\'ve lost the person, but they don\\'t feel responsible for that person\\'s death.\", \"Suicide is different, when somebody commits suicide, their family and friends feel responsible.\", \"They have no answers to all the questions that they have.\", \"They could never get an answer.So you believe the note will take away all that pain?it\\'ll mitigate that pain?Okay.\", \"I can tell you from experience that notes, notes don\\'t really help.\", \"If anything, it\\'s another artifact that they can agonize over.\", \"I know it\\'s hard to see from your perspective, because you\\'re kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain you want now, but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their lives, because they\\'ve lost you.\", \"And it\\'s a it\\'s a special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someone\\'s death.\", \"I know you don\\'t want that.I know it\\'s frustrating.\", \"I know it\\'s hard to understand.\", \"The times when you\\'ve gone to the hospital before, you have felt better.\", \"Your outlook was completely different, not 100%.\", \"But it was completely different when you came out.\", \"I mean, you\\'re still a little down, but nowhere near the depression we\\'d want to hurt yourself.\", \"Is it possible if you go to the hospital this time, you could come out feeling better again?I\\'m gonna make arrangements to get you out of the hospital.\", \"I know.\", \"I know you don\\'t.\", \"And we\\'ve had this conversation before.\", \"Right?\", \"I realized that, you know, you\\'re not happy with some of the conditions there.\", \"But you usually talk finally about the groups.\", \"Right?\", \"You usually do well in the groups.\", \"And typically, well, every time right, every time you\\'ve been in the hospital, you\\'ve come out feeling better.\", \"I know it\\'s not what you want to hear.\", \"I know you want me to be happy that you\\'re gonna enjoy life, but that would make me happy.\", \"That would make anybody happy.\", \"I know you think it would make you happy.\", \"But I can tell you it\\'s not the answer.\", \"I\\'d like you to go voluntarily through this process.\", \"Will you do that?All right.\", \"I\\'ll go make those arrangements and we can show you.\", \"Okay?Hi Joe, How are doing today?just okay?So, can you can tell me a little bit more about that?Do you want to die?sometimes?Okay.\", \"Do you have any plan as to how you would end your life if you decide to do that?just same pills that you prescribed for depression?Do you feel like you\\'re going to carry out that plan?Today you\\'re a little worried that you will, or you\\'re a little closer to it then than usual.\", \"We\\'ve talked about this before in the past, you\\'ve come in, you\\'ve had kind of that same plan to pills and the thoughts and what what stops you those times was stuck in the past.Alright, so there\\'s times before when you had the same feeling, right?\", \"You felt just as bad as you feel now really down hopeless.\", \"What happened a few days after that, after the thoughts suicide went away.\", \"What was your outlook on life that?So if you feel like this time these suicidal thoughts are markedly different than what you\\'ve experienced before.more intense?When you think about this, these feelings on before we talked about I know this relationship surrounding relationships, the same thing this time?in a sense of hopelessness?So this time is different because you feel it\\'s very less situational, less tired of relationships and more, Well, philosophical, you\\'re looking at your outlook and you\\'re saying it\\'s not gonna get any better.\", \"What\\'s the point going on?\", \"So this is a little bit new territory for you.\", \"How long we\\'ve been feeling this way with the  intensity right now?What was prevented you from hurting yourself those last week?Have you made any gestures to harm yourself?\", \"Like if you went and grabbed the pills or went to the medicine cabinet looks at the pills, anything like that.\", \"Don\\'t think further than look at them?And what do you end up doing?and how about the pain that you would cause husband and the rest of your family?You don\\'t want that?And when relatives of somebody that committed suicide, hear about the suicide?\", \"Who do they blame?\", \"So I know this is a tough time right?\", \"But the good news is you\\'re here talking to me about it.\", \"Right?\", \"Now you\\'re talking about it.\", \"I\\'m gonna guess that you want to do something for bad to feel better.\", \"Are you gonna carry out your plan or you\\'re gonna hurt yourself?are you going to?Okay, so can we can we do this?\", \"Your husband\\'s at home?\", \"Right.\", \"You mentioned you take two pills once a day?Before for bed?Can we would you be willing to sign a release so I can talk to him.\", \"He can hold on to those pills.\", \"Just give you the pill each night take one and I will that be okay?Is there anything else in the medicine cabinet or anywhere else in the house to give you a danger to?all the tools?Would he be willing to do that?Okay.\", \"If I get release for the talk you might , sign it?Okay.\", \"Are you familiar before, are you familiar with this concept we talked about before contracting for safety, or the prior time.\", \"So, you\\'ve been the state similar to this.\", \"Can you promise me that you\\'re going to not hurting yourself.Let\\'s be a little certain that okay, sets up that for a more.\", \"I know this is a rough time trying to appreciate how rough it is for you.\", \"I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before.\", \"Now you do tend to pull out of this.\", \"And you look back at a lot differently.\", \"But in the moment, it\\'s hard to see that.\", \"That doesn\\'t necessarily make this any easier.\", \"But if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression.\", \"You\\'ll probably have a different outlook.\", \"If history is any evidence.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"All right.\", \"So what do you have planned for us today?So, are you gonna be alone anytime between when you leave here and when you come and see me anymore?Okay, if these feelings intensified, or you do feel you\\'re gonna act on them, which promised to call me and kill me call 911 I\\'m gonna get that release so you can talk to your husband.\", \"And then see it for a few minutes or so point for more.\", \"All right.Thanks, Joe.Are you doing today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.So reduce feelings of depression.\", \"Yes, that\\'d be a cool okay.\", \"Yes.\", \"So Sounds like a good goal.\", \"So what objectives what tasks Do you think that you could do?\", \"That would help you to feel less depressed?Have you had a plan before we have walked regularly?So Walking has worked before.And you notice that you\\'re walking less since you\\'ve had a first impression.\", \"Isince you\\'re on the topic of homework, which is something you think you can do there, you mentioned that it\\'s stressful and overwhelming.\", \"And that sounds like the type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"Do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is?feel like maybe you\\'re starting the homework late compared to when it\\'s due.That\\'s the feeling maybe of overwhelmed.So, yeah, you\\'re right.\", \"It sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right.\", \"So if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier, and do it in small bits, okay.\", \"Instead of me waiting more or less the last minute, right.\", \"That would reduce the mean likely, I would think reduce some of the stressed feelings of being overwhelmed.So one, make that your sec objective then so you have the walking, okay.\", \"And then you\\'ll have trying to space out the homework.\", \"sound good.\", \"All right.What other objectives might work?that worked in the past for you.So it\\'s a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homeworkIt has kind of come in the singing parts fun for it sounds like but also there\\'s a social component seems likeYou seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing.so far.\", \"This is justmaking the time.Good.\", \"All right.\", \"So we\\'ll make that the third objective.\", \"So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently.\", \"And then singing and that, that socializing, it\\'s the companies that, that singing that\\'s great.\", \"So three objectives is good.\", \"I try to get to four.\", \"If you have one.\", \"Is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you\\'ve associated with not feeling depressed whenYes, she does.\", \"Okay, so this seems like a good, good objective to Yes.\", \"So you\\'re suggesting maybe visiting her more often?So again, kind of kind of getting away from the school stressors.\", \"Just take taking a break from it for a day.\", \"Yes.\", \"And then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with.\", \"Good.\", \"Good.\", \"All right.\", \"So I want to go through each one of these.\", \"And just make sure that we\\'re kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do, but these are all specific, which is good.\", \"Do you feel these are all achievable?\", \"These are things you can do.\", \"I think so.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Well, someone that knew done in the past, right, So now we have the specific and the achievable.\", \"I don\\'t want to get too personal and more tricky, which is making it measurable.\", \"I like to do here.\", \"I don\\'t want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives.\", \"I want you to decide.\", \"But I want to see We can quantify, in some manner, how often you\\'ll be able to do these different things or how, you know, quite like a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but, but first with the walking.\", \"So in a given week, say what\\'s realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking?\", \"How many times?Okay.\", \"Do you have two particular days in line days for your responsibilities aren\\'t too great.\", \"You have that opportunity?Okay.\", \"Let\\'s go one day, one time, one time a week.\", \"Let\\'s talk with one and then we\\'ll see what happens.so what day of the week are you thinking?Consider a window of opportunity you see on Monday.Wednesday?Once you have a particular time range, you like to walk a few times a day,That\\'s a good time for you.\", \"As the time you can get out of house,6:30 is kind of a good, that\\'s a good time.\", \"Yeah.\", \"630 good.\", \"So we\\'ll start with that objective.\", \"The Walking Every Wednesday at 630 for every amount of time are comfortable with.\", \"So, the homework is a little trickier, right?\", \"This is about spacing it out.\", \"Okay?\", \"So the homework assignments, they\\'re stressing you out.\", \"How much time did they take?\", \"Last few few questions.\", \"How much time do they take to complete?\", \"Generally?\", \"Like an hour?\", \"SoIf you had the average oflet\\'s go to worst case, let\\'s go two and a half hours just to cover code worst case will generally be the worst case.when we get three, two to three hours, okay.\", \"And then how much time do you have when it\\'s assigned to when it\\'s due usuallyA couple weeks.\", \"Yeah.So I was ready to do the work to ease into the last Okay, yeah, I could see how that would be stressful.\", \"what day of the week isn\\'t usually a Sunday.So you have Tuesday, and then you have another Tuesday and the week after that, you have three hours of work.\", \"And those two weeks.Yeah, will be the first day and time but kind of like when you specified Wednesday 630 that\\'s gonna be a walking time, right right at the time, and you can start the homework because the first timeHow long do you foreseeSo to get some time to decompress and round Alright, so from eight to nine on Tuesday, or Wednesday, on Wednesday, you\\'ll get the first third of the homework.\", \"And then and then just stop.\", \"Okay, that\\'d be that\\'d be done for the night.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"That\\'s some big plans.\", \"How about that second hour?Thursday, so it\\'s just one day apart.Oh, do come Thursday.\", \"Yeah.\", \"an hour.\", \"Yes.\", \"And what hour do you have in mind?So but 7070 so one night, Wednesday be at nine o\\'clock.\", \"And then on Thursday, seven nine was two hours.\", \"Seven days.\", \"Sorry.\", \"Okay.\", \"So now just the last hour remainsthrough Sunday.\", \"Okay.\", \"So you you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night?\", \"Yeah, the rest of that time off.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Sure that\\'s achievable.\", \"That seems like you\\'re, you\\'re getting a lot in there, but you think you can do it?that sounds good.\", \"All right.\", \"What time Sunday,to five to six, five to six.And I\\'m assuming it won\\'t run over because we kind of have to be on the high side, but if it did, I would be able to go five to seven So that\\'s kind of like, yeah, flexible time there.\", \"Yes.\", \"So what would that feel like to get your homework done?Okay.\", \"So, and there\\'s a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on Sunday, where you need more time, and you don\\'t want to stress, you still have that Wednesday after you walk bacon.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So that could be like your, your backup.\", \"Yes, that makes sense.\", \"Yes.\", \"Because you still have another six days to have done after that.\", \"Right.\", \"All right.\", \"So all those seem realistic and achievable.Every so many Fridays.So, so this is this isn\\'t every Friday commitment.\", \"Right, this thing?about two hours, two hours.\", \"So two hours every Friday.\", \"There\\'s something really enjoyed though.\", \"So and it sounds like you look forward to it.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So Friday, two hours, I guess.\", \"Yes.\", \"afternoon or evening.\", \"Evening.\", \"Okay.Yeah.\", \"Good.\", \"Okay.\", \"So that was the last objective this is.\", \"This is I guess about a whole day commitment, right?\", \"Because you go to the beach, it\\'s an hour drive, so you probably wouldn\\'t want to go down for just a few hours.\", \"More like the whole day, would they?So how many times and say a month, like once?\", \"Once a month?\", \"Okay.\", \"So you go down on Saturday morning and come back?That\\'s something to look forward to.\", \"Yes.\", \"Is that something that would be okay, in terms of like, because on Friday night, potentially, you\\'d be out.\", \"Right and then Saturday.Okay, that\\'s a good idea.\", \"So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out?\", \"Yes.\", \"When you know that Saturday is comingjust take a break that time.\", \"Yes.\", \"Restore.\", \"All right.\", \"So that\\'s four separate objectives.\", \"And what I want to do since I\\'ve kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment just take a break, and print this up for you.\", \"Okay, we\\'ll work on the rest of your goals next time but I want you to have this so you can get started on it right away.\", \"So before I print these up as a changes you want to makeAnd if it doesn\\'t work, can we tweak?\", \"Oh yeah, we can always make changes.\", \"Maybe certain things will work really well.\", \"It Certain things, we\\'ll have to take off the list altogether, maybe substitute something else.\", \"Yeah, we can, we can make edits to it the whole time you\\'re here.\", \"Okay, we can just make a document that changes as as needed.\", \"But if you think it\\'s a good starting place, I\\'ll go and print this up as it is, and give you a copy and we can resume with today\\'s session.\", \"And then next time I see in a week, or call the rest of the treatment plan.\", \"Beside the plan, yes.\", \"Thanks, Allison.\", \"Hi Joe, How are doing today?Just alright?rough time of things?what was causing it?You don\\'t feel like continuing with your life.Have you been having thoughts of suicide?So you have some thoughts about it, what prevents you from doing it?They would be hurt?So it almost sounds as if by squaring it down a bit.Have you worked out in a specific plan or so?So, this how long been going on this feelings?Okay, so and today and maybe the past few days been kind of new feeling that a new thought you don\\'t want to continue life continue living.\", \"But at the same time, you don\\'t want to commit suicide.\", \"You don\\'t have a plan.So if, we\\'ll call it feeling depression, right, because that\\'s what we\\'ve talked about before, is the depression will go away?\", \"Do you think that would change your outlook on?Alright these suicidal ideations I know you\\'re, you\\'re telling me you haven\\'t had them before, so I can appreciate that they\\'re scary.\", \"They could be scary, even if you hadn\\'t had them before, are fairly common with depression.\", \"And you\\'ve, it sounds like what you\\'re really saying is you\\'re frustrated, and you\\'re tired of being sick.\", \"And I think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if you happen to regularly talk about your family before and it would seem to be very upset.\", \"When I see your life has value.\", \"I want to try to hang on to that thought.\", \"After we\\'re done here today, tell me what you have planned for us today.Anywhere else you will go?Can you do that for me?\", \"Can you go there?And we\\'ll kind of play by here from that point.\", \"I\\'m going to see you today.\", \"We\\'ll we\\'ll do some work today.\", \"Well, I\\'ll see you again tomorrow.\", \"All right.\", \"So if you could spend a night there that that would be a wiser choice, given your thoughts and your feelings right now.\", \"Have you ever haven\\'t used the term contract for safety?Okay.\", \"So what it means is you kind of an only if it\\'s authentic, I want this to be true is kind of where you promised me that you\\'re going to be safe until I see you again, right for the foreseeable future that you don\\'t have any intent or plan to harm yourself.\", \"Can you make that promise to me now?\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So give me a minute and I\\'ll come back and overcome a bit today.\", \"And now I\\'m going to schedule you see tomorrow as well.okayThanks, Joe.Hi Rebecca, How are you doing?Pretty good.\", \"Can I ask you what handed only write with?Your right hand would be all right to ask you some questions about your memory.Okay, thank you.\", \"I\\'m gonna ask you some questions and give you some problems to solve.\", \"Please try to answer them as best as you can.\", \"What year is this?what season of the year is this?what is the date today?what day of the week is this ?What month is thisCan you tell me what country we are in?Do you know what county we\\'re in?Do you know what city we\\'re in?do the name or the address of this building?What floor of the building are we on?I am going to name three objects.\", \"After I\\'ve said them, I want you to repeat them back to me.\", \"Apple, Table, Pennyremember what they are because I\\'m going to ask you to name them again in a few minutes.Now I\\'m going to give you a word and ask you to spell it forwards and backwards.\", \"The word is world.\", \"First, Can you spell it forwards?Now, can you spell it backwards?What were the three objects I asked you to remember earlier?What is this called?I would like you to repeat a phrase after me.\", \"The phrases no ifs, ands or butsI want you to read the words on the page.\", \"I\\'m going to hold up and then do with the word say.Thank you.\", \"take this paper in your right hand.\", \"Fold the paper once with both hands and put the paper down on your lap.\", \"On this piece of paper, write any complete sentence on that piece of paper for me.\", \"Thank you.\", \"Here\\'s a drawing, please copy the drawing on the same paper.\", \"Thank you.\", \"That concludes this test on that.\", \"Thank you for your cooperation.Hi Smith How you doing today?I\\'m doing all right.\", \"How things been since last week?okay, sounds like a couple things may be going on.\", \"In child has been sick so youre taken off days.\", \"So there\\'s a little worried about your relationship with your employer.\", \"At the same time, you want to make sure you\\'re taking good care of your child having trouble reconciling those two.All right.\", \"What was the last time it happened, can you described what happened?HmmAlright, so let me see.\", \"Let\\'s go through each day.\", \"Right.\", \"So the first day when we discovered that she was sick, right well, we Thinking that when you had to call out of workOkay, so you\\'re thinking was this isn\\'t ideal, but I can I can live with it.\", \"Just one, just one day?How about one on one, day two, when you realize that you\\'re gonna have to take a second day,Okay.\", \"So a little more stressful version of what happened on day one.\", \"And then how about when you discovered that you had to take a third day off?So guilty and a bad mom.\", \"And that was mostly on third.\", \"That was the worst of it.Now this go up against the weekend was the third day Friday.\", \"All right, so, so then you kind of knew that by Monday, things would be better.\", \"So tell me what happened when you returned to work on Monday?just do what I can to not miss more.\", \"So they said that?so, they were understanding?Did you anticipate worst reaction than you experienced?As a sort of like it took them by surprise?And they were investing a lot of energy in thinking about that?And when was the second how long?So how has this week been back at work?other than that first and other ?And there\\'s been no more absences?Okay, earlier you mentioned being a good mom How a good mom look lik?And you\\'re a little worried through this was last experience you\\'re talking about that you didn\\'t rise level of good mom?Okay, so so good, mom\\'s more about More than just rather, your behavior, right, what you\\'re doing is about what you\\'re also thinking.\", \"So you took care of your child.\", \"But your mind, your thoughts are somewhere else some of the time.\", \"And that\\'s where you feel like you\\'ve, you\\'ve wandered out of the good mom area.\", \"Okay, I\\'ve been on the other side, how about a good employee?\", \"Did you mention that?\", \"You want to be a good employee?\", \"What\\'s what\\'s that look like?And that\\'s where you feel like with the sort of the last workdays you missed.\", \"You missed three.\", \"Okay, how about last year?\", \"How many days have you missed?So that\\'s understandable but excluding that?Okay, total nine?And you\\'re allowed?I can see that will cause worry what happens if you go over the 10Is anybody that you work with that you could ask that question to HR department?I\\'m just thinking because you\\'re just one day away, from being at that number might be prudent just to talk with them and see.\", \"See, you know what to expect, right?\", \"So this whole thing though, the missing days caused you anxiety, frustration.about any type of feeling down at all?Okay, so that so as far as your child is concerned in your relationship with your child, yes, some anxiety relationship at work, some anxiety, but the sadness mostly surrounds how you feel you\\'re treating your job.\", \"Of all the emotions of frustration, anxiety, what I\\'ll refer to as depression I should say sadness.\", \"What\\'s bothering you the most?\", \"What?\", \"emotional response is probably the most?How would you rate yourself right now as a mother if say 10 was the best mother you could imagine?\", \"Right?\", \"And one was the absolute worst?Okay.\", \"That\\'s pretty good, right?\", \"What would be the cutoff to where?\", \"What\\'s the cutoff score?\", \"And that will scale I just gave it for good mother and not good mother.so five is good enough.Okay.\", \"OkaySo if you look at somebody else, another person in similar situation of five would be acceptable.\", \"Right?\", \"But how about for you specifically?that\\'s not gonna cut it?Well, we\\'ve cut it.\", \"and you\\'re an eightsure?not sure.\", \"Okay.\", \"So you\\'re close to the border.\", \"Like you\\'re close to the border on you\\'re your value system of being not a good mother.Okay.\", \"Now, what do you want to be?eight or higher where you are in s you said?okay.\", \"So you want to be the parent sounds likeI mean, I think people are driven to, to do their best.\", \"But is it crucial to be perfectly crucial to be a 10?Remember before in other sessions for the situations you\\'ve brought in here, we\\'ve talked about dysfunctional thinking, irrational thinking.\", \"How does reflect on that, like the usefulness of of these thoughts?\", \"The, you know, the other mothers can be a five and B.\", \"And that\\'s, that\\'s good, right?\", \"You need to be an eight or hire a nine or 10 , does it seem useful, like a useful way of thinking?Okay, So it does have a useful side does have an unusual side less than useful?Yeah.\", \"So I guess one things I\\'m getting at here is has to worry has the anxiety or it paid off for you?Why not?\", \"So you\\'re suffering with it?it might make you a little more vigilant but mostly most, it\\'s just causing suffering.So at the heart of it, you\\'re not a bad mom.\", \"Right?\", \"You\\'re in good mom category.\", \"You\\'re a good employee.\", \"Right.\", \"But your, your way of dying yourself, Your perception is that you\\'re not doing a great job at either one.And that\\'s the thinking I\\'m getting that it\\'s not, you know, it\\'s not necessarily irrational.\", \"I\\'m thinking it\\'s just less than useful.\", \"It\\'s dysfunctional.Yeah, we\\'re talking about that third day, right.\", \"The the third day of work you had to you had to call off.\", \"And do you remember any specific thoughts that are going through your mind on that?\", \"What was that a morning when you figured it out?\", \"Like a Friday morning?so your thought was, am I gonna get fired?\", \"And then what was the feeling that that came right after that?maybe some anxiety?Were you able to do anything to address that panic or your anxiety at that time?\", \"Like, did you tell yourself anything?\", \"Or did you take some action?and how did you feel after you  consciously had that thought?the whole time.\", \"Probably all the way till Monday, right when you returned to work?So we\\'ve talked before about self talk, you might remember me saying the phrase adaptive response, right?\", \"So it\\'s the kind of pre packaged response we have two thoughts that we\\'ve identified is not so useful.\", \"So degree, those thoughts like, Am I going to get fired and all that?\", \"Not very useful in that moment?\", \"understandable.\", \"Right, but not useful.So what\\'s you had sort of some self talk that you apply on your own, what some other self talk with some other another thought that you could think or something you can say yourself that could counter an automatic thought like that.\", \"Like, specifically, I\\'m gonna lose my job.So, so there the self talk there is there\\'s no clear indication that\\'s gonna happen, So why borrow the worry?\", \"Right?\", \"How about other habit adaptive behaviors?\", \"We talked about the importance of support systems before other sessions.\", \"Is there anybody else that could watch your child if you were really running up against that?Did you explore those options for this last time?So none of those individuals were available?Is there any other options you have for care?\", \"Was that it?that seems reasonable.\", \"Okay, so there are some things you\\'ve already done.\", \"Right.\", \"And I think at this point, since to address I know this is the lesser of your worries, which is your employer, you\\'re more worried about being a good mom, but to go look at the employer side first.\", \"Second, you can talk to HR, you can try to understand what the consequences are for going over explained that doesn\\'t appear to be your fault.\", \"Okay.\", \"And I don\\'t know what you can do in terms of support, maybe try to get a better awareness of the schedules when they\\'re available and or convey the nature of your problem to them.\", \"Customer Support So that was one issue.\", \"Now if you highlight more prominently though, the good mother want to touch on that as well.\", \"You did everything you had to do to care for your child?Are you sure?okay hundred percent ?Okay.\", \"And we\\'ll get to that but your behavior behavior.\", \"Yeah, you did everything a good mom would do.Okay.\", \"So is it okay?\", \"If you\\'re doing everything you need to do to think thoughts that don\\'t seem congruent with that, you know, the distract you away from that?It\\'s not ideal.\", \"So you\\'d really rather be have the ability to be really focused on what\\'s going on your child to the exclusion of what\\'s going on other circumstances?So by addressing the employer issue, that might give you a little relief one good mom ish.\", \"All right.\", \"So here\\'s another opportunity to talk about dysfunctional thoughts.\", \"I think that is reflect on whether you\\'re a good mom or not, you\\'re really basing it on this idea that if I\\'m thinking about something other than my child, I\\'m in the wrong place in terms of being a good mom.\", \"Are you only being distracted?so that pushes you on a one to 10 scale?the more thoughts you have like that you think of it as like pushing you down toward five.Okay.\", \"So when you have those thoughts what\\'s an adaptive response or you know, self talk, what can you tell yourself in those moments?Who doesn\\'t know you\\'re distracted or worried?Just you?So the self talk that would be I\\'m doing what I have to do to be a good mom.\", \"And that\\'s what my child says.\", \"RightBut I have these understandable thoughts that come in where I worry about other things and more or less justice what it is, right?\", \"I mean, you\\'re permitted to worry about things life isn\\'t going to be worryfreeBut we can, we can work to not suffer more than we have to That kind of makes sense?Yeah, it\\'s a little less than useful it\\'s not, you know, I want this important distinction.\", \"It\\'s not good or bad right.\", \"And those words have a function right in our in our lives, but they\\'re a little dangerous when applied in terms of mental health when they\\'re applied to things like you know, good mom, bad mom.\", \"But doesn\\'t leave a lot of gray area to talk about.\", \"improvement.\", \"Right?\", \"Also, it seems like what you\\'re describing your, your way into the good mom category anyway.\", \"Sure.\", \"8 or 10 I think most people would be happy with an eight out of 10.\", \"So it\\'s not like you\\'ve drifted down toward five before somewhere.\", \"Okay.\", \"So there\\'s a couple different Yeah, I know we talked about two different subjects, right, but they\\'re related the work situation and situation care for a child.\", \"But those are some self talk strategies.\", \"So I\\'d like you to do when you go home today, and I would I would ask you to do it today if you can.\", \"Okay, I think it\\'s important in the states in terms of time, near when we\\'re having this conversation.\", \"If you could try to document some of those automatic thoughts.\", \"Remember, I gave you a worksheet before and then work on some of your own calm adaptive response.\", \"Maybe around this area or maybe about other areas as well, it doesn\\'t.\", \"It\\'s okay.\", \"If you have other problems you\\'d want to apply the model to, but certainly around this issue of the childcare versus the work performance.\", \"That\\'s the real struggle that\\'s going on right now inside of you.\", \"Is that right?Do you think you\\'d be able to have that completed?\", \"next week?Okay.\", \"So we\\'ll leave it there and I\\'ll see you next week.Thanks, ma\\'am.Hey Jill, how are you doing today?Little stressed, What\\'s going on?Okay, we\\'ve talked about some different struggles you\\'ve had as you balance work and school and everything.\", \"What specifically is bothering now it seems like you\\'re a little more distressed today.what kind of grades you\\'ve been getting lately?anything else?Okay.\", \"That\\'s usually considered pretty good, right?okay, you\\'re working hard to get the same grade?Have you been getting any feedback from professors or your classmates about your performance?Alright, so before when you got A\\'s you were working hard to have a job but not to the level of precision in terms of like the detail in the assignment that you are now.\", \"You\\'re trying to get more information about the assignments, you\\'re working harder to get the same grade that used to get beforeSo when you\\'re when you\\'re having this feeling that I guess it\\'s a feeling of anxiety or stress, yeah.\", \"What\\'s going through your mind?\", \"What are you thinking about?So what grade would you have to receive for you to feel like you have failedright below an A isn\\'t A minus?What about A plus?a B?No, no, it\\'d be worse.\", \"Okay.\", \"So an A you can tolerate an A minus you\\'re not exactly sure but you think you couldBut a B plus and a B?so what would it mean to you if you received a B?But you didn\\'t try hard enough that you didn\\'t do enough.\", \"What would it mean If that were true?That you were lazy?Okay, now we we\\'ve talked before about automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions right in other sessions and one of the cognitive distortions is this idea that unuseful type of thinking and Aaron thinking is when you think of everything in terms of like, Black or White, all or nothing?\", \"So sounds like you have a little tolerance for like an A minus you\\'re not completely there.\", \"But generally, it\\'s kind of an A of some type, right?\", \"Or you\\'re not interested.\", \"Right.\", \"So we get down to you didn\\'t try hard enough and if that were true, the new would be lazy.\", \"Right?\", \"Which, you know, having senior these last few sessions is clear to me.\", \"You\\'re not lazy.\", \"But that\\'s the body.Now, it seems that earlier in your earlier years in the program, this was the Acer effortless for you, but you\\'d have to work as hard for them.\", \"what\\'s what do you think has changed?You mentioned part of it was you can get close to the end, right.\", \"So is there anything else?so if I\\'m reading you, right, you you really didn\\'t have any competition for this award that you were aware of.\", \"Right?\", \"And now you feel like you really do,I\\'m paradoxically that\\'s caused you to be more anxious and more stressed and your performing but you\\'re still getting the A\\'s which are working harder to get the A\\'s,So what would it mean if you couldn\\'t get the award if you didn\\'t with the, what\\'s the name of the new was first name with a new choice choice?\", \"Okay, but of choice once award, and you didn\\'t want me?So its all or nothing if you don\\'t win the award.Right, but you\\'re not really losing a race because you would still graduate?You\\'re you\\'re just not getting a word, which you would like, right and which would be great.\", \"Right, and certainly accomplishment.\", \"But the reason you came to the program was to get the degree,but it\\'s now it\\'s now taken on some importance for you winning award has been a real goal.So with the new student choice coming in, I have this increased competition.\", \"And that\\'s causing me anxiety is caused you to work hard for the same grade.\", \"All right.\", \"So, as we talked before, you have a tendency to be, I mean, this as a compliment a little perfectionistic.\", \"Right.\", \"I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily a bad thing.\", \"It is taking too far, It can be right it can be not useful.\", \"Ever hear the phrase Perfect is the enemy of good.\", \"No.\", \"Does that make sense what that might mean?\", \"Yeah.\", \"So this desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing you not even to perform well.\", \"Right?you\\'re still getting the A\\'s but it\\'s called the anxiety and you\\'re working hard andSo is there any way that you cannot win the award and still walk away?\", \"having accomplished worthy goals?\", \"Or does it have to be the award or none of this was worth it?Your word validates all the hard work you\\'ve done.And in your mind, losing the award invalidates all the hard work you\\'ve done, right?\", \"But in reality, there\\'s probably a between ground there might have been a shade of gray, where you\\'re still an excellent student, you still graduate, you just don\\'t have an extra plaque hanging on the wall, whatever the word is, right.\", \"That\\'s really all you\\'d be missing.\", \"Right?With this award have any impact on employment?And you didn\\'t know about it when you first came in, and you\\'re already working hard.So in a sense, and of course, we can\\'t do this, for the sense of you could forget about the award.\", \"Right?\", \"You probably win it.Because you\\'re already doing so well.\", \"But the thought of this potential failure, right away the word that\\'s holding you back,Yeah, there\\'s no there\\'s no tolerance for any type of mistake?So so now that with the award out there, you really feel like you can\\'t make any type of mistake or you just go right to, to a catastrophe?So free so for you to feel better about this one way, I guess right would be to not help have to not place so much value in way.Yeah, you really want that.\", \"And it would be great.\", \"And that\\'s okay.\", \"Right?\", \"We talked about the adaptive responses before, right?\", \"What are what\\'s your automatic thought you have when you\\'re sitting there and trying to get every assignment right and you you\\'re kind of vaguely thinking about not losing or not winning this award was the automatic thought that comes to mind?yeah, when you\\'re doing your work, and you sense that anxiety come on, right as you start maybe vaguely thinking about winning or losing this award, right?\", \"Like it\\'s losing it Really?\", \"What\\'s going through your mind right that moment?to ensure that you\\'re gonna get that award?Right.\", \"So at a higher level, one of your thoughts is, I must win that award.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"I mean, that that\\'s probably somewhere.\", \"Is there any type of adaptive response you could apply that moment, that statement, or kind of, well, that\\'s an absolute statement, right?\", \"I must win that award.\", \"Is there any type of adaptive response you could play at that moment that could counteract that on thoughtYeah.Okay, so so you could say, it\\'d be nice to win the award.\", \"But in the end, it\\'s not really gonna make the difference in my life in terms of my careerand, and that\\'s a fair, adaptive response, right?\", \"You do want to win it, right?\", \"Truthfully, and it would be nice to win it right.\", \"Who doesn\\'t want to win the award, right?\", \"But if you don\\'t, you were still good student.\", \"You\\'re still gonna be a good connection and your career still good before.\", \"Do you believe in that adaptive response?\", \"Do you believe that adaptive response is true?So what percentage of the time Do you believe that adaptive response is true?so 50% of time?And the other half, you\\'re not really buying.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So what advice Well, let\\'s use choice, right?\", \"choices in the same situation, in a sense, in that she\\'s, well, maybe not knowing what she is working toward this award as wellLet\\'s assume.\", \"Let\\'s assume she knows about it.\", \"Right?\", \"He\\'s in a similar situation.\", \"What advice would you give her?\", \"She\\'s kind of obsessing about this in the same way that you are.Your advice to her seems positive and uplifting.\", \"Mostly, your advice to her is more positive, uplifting what you\\'re telling yourself internally,So if that advices adequate.\", \"I feel It is adequate and appropriate for her.\", \"Why isn\\'t it adequate probably for you?But you would agree your advice to choice as you frame it to me is useful, right?\", \"But you\\'re just having trouble applying that to yourself?Smooth.\", \"That\\'s what you need to work on a bit.\", \"So you can kind of see the logic of all this, but your feelings don\\'t match.Alright, so here\\'s what I want you to do.\", \"You familiar with the thought record that I introduced you in the first session where you can outline your situation and your feelings and you\\'ve explained all this to me, I want you to actually complete one thought records.\", \"I know after having set it all might seem like doubling the work.\", \"But I think it\\'s something changes when you write something down.\", \"Okay, I have to face it on paper.\", \"And also, it\\'s a good tool to remember exactly what you\\'re thinking.\", \"And then work through the adaptive response section and their smiles at the bottom of thought record questions you can ask yourself to help you form that adaptive response.\", \"And maybe write out a few different ones.\", \"But there\\'s plenty of room on the forum.\", \"You see it, right, That\\'s actually the largest grid cell is the one on adaptive responses, that the responses don\\'t have to be short.\", \"like yours wasn\\'t short.\", \"There\\'s really good they can they can be long and they can So be realistic, like, I\\'d like to win.\", \"It would be good to win.\", \"But Alice should have to be successful.\", \"I thinl  the adaptive response kicked out is to the downside of not having success, okay?\", \"It doesn\\'t have to be completely positive.\", \"Okay, has to be realistic and useful.\", \"And, as importantly, you have to believe it.\", \"Okay, there\\'s a place on there to note what percentage you believe that you could write that in.\", \"Okay, I know we\\'ll look at that from week to week and, you know, as we move closer to your graduation, hopefully it\\'ll bring you some relief for missing anxiety.\", \"that\\'s sounds like a good plan?Thanks.Hi Alice, how you doing today?\", \"You make it here okay to the office?Good, good.\", \"So I understand that you come to see me because you have a situation, how?Okay.\", \"I\\'ll try to help you that I\\'m sure your your get started.\", \"Right?Good.\", \"I want to make sure I go over a few disclosures about the counseling relationship before we get into assessment, which is the first stage.\", \"Right.\", \"We\\'ll ask you a lot of questions.\", \"Okay, that\\'s your past and what\\'s going on now.\", \"And then after assessment, we\\'ll move into counseling.\", \"So we come in roughly once a week.\", \"But first I want to get through kind of a piece on confidentiality.We kind of I\\'m glad you brought that up, about attorneys.\", \"Attorneys and clients have confidentiality, and counselors and clients have confidentiality, but the two types are different.\", \"So I\\'ll explain to you how it worked between you and I.\", \"But no, that is a little bit different than it works between the attorney and their client.Absolutely.\", \"So, one thing about a casting lationship all this time you spend here, the notes they\\'ll take in during the assessment and the progress notes later on.\", \"Because all of a chart with your name on it will be stored in a secure place.\", \"All that is confidential, and next to that word confidential as an astress.\", \"Right?\", \"There\\'s exceptions.\", \"Okay.\", \"And what I want to explain to you are those exceptions to confidentiality, because confidentiality isn\\'t absolute.Yes.Yeah.\", \"But they\\'re very specific situations that occur that permit that or mandate that.\", \"Okay, I want to review those with you before we move on.\", \"Okay.\", \"Does that make sense?I agree.\", \"That\\'s a good, good way to look at it.\", \"So the first exception to confidentiality is when you give me permission to release information that you\\'ve disclosed and interactions we\\'ve had during counseling This is actually fairly common.\", \"For example, do you have a primary care physician?\", \"So depending on we talk about you may want him or her to know about discussions.\", \"So you may sign a release, that gives that physician the right to talk to me directly.\", \"right.\", \"Furthermore, your issues with are part of your concern with your son.\", \"So say and I don\\'t necessarily foresee this but say, later on, as we work together, you want him to come in for a session just to talk about something right?\", \"You would have to sign release confidentiality, so we could be here and talk with me.\", \"That makes sense?Okay.\", \"The other exceptions are insurance company.\", \"So when you fill out your screen packet insurance Insurance companies have access to like progress knows the assessment, anything on the chart and they\\'re generally responsible this information I don\\'t know of any instances where they\\'re irresponsible with it.\", \"But I just think it\\'s important that you know that anything I write in the chart anything in the chart itself technically the insurance company can ask for and periodically could review.\", \"Again, I\\'ve never seen in my career any difficulty with that, but as far as I know that information would be transmitted off site so to speak.\", \"And when this agency bills it would be transmitted your information be transmitted off site to the insurance companythe progress notes, don\\'t for standard billing, but information about the type of session we had length of the session.\", \"any of that and some other personal information about you to identify you would go to them also they know a service was provided.\", \"Like I said, There They\\'re generally very responsible information, large companies that have done this for a while, right,they have access to different types of data.\", \"Another exception to confidentiality and again, I don\\'t foresee necessarily a this happening, but I want to tell you about the limits of it is in the event that I feel that you\\'re going to harm, or there\\'s a high potential that you\\'re gonna harm yourself or someone else.\", \"In that instance, I\\'m obligated to act.\", \"Now, we\\'re gonna probably talk about a lot of different elements of your life through the next however many weeks were together.\", \"Okay?\", \"When, and if, and again, I don\\'t predict this.\", \"You have some sort of suicidal ideation or you want to harm smell.\", \"So in the unlikely event that happens, I would only release information I have to release to protect you or the person that I\\'m worried about.\", \"So if you review a lie like deep, dark secrets, and then you tell me that you want to go harm a relative of yours, right?\", \"I have a duty to warn that relative of what you plan on doing, where you are at the moment, what threats you\\'ve made, but I\\'m certainly not going to tell them about your deepest, darkest secrets to be revealed.\", \"Okay, unless they\\'re directly relevant to protecting.\", \"Okay, it\\'s very unlikely they would be,I know.\", \"Yeah, but I just want to let you know that these know this confidentiality information I release is limited to just what I need to release.\", \"Similarly, if you have any type of suicide ideation, and I was had to contact somebody come pick you up like law enforcement.\", \"I would only tell them I knew tell them from the get to the hospital and get you in a safe environment.\", \"This I want to take an opportunity Talking about the suicide ideation.\", \"So you know that just because you have suicidal ideation, like thoughts, a lot of people think about suicide from time to time, or even homicidal ideation or thoughts, you\\'re going to harm someone by not saying kill, but it\\'s harm does not by any means automatically me, I\\'m gonna call police think of it as something that opens a discussion certainly about your safety and someone else\\'s safety.\", \"But that\\'s not, you know, we don\\'t go automatically from there.\", \"You know, that is, if you have a thought of suicide to the hospital.\", \"There\\'s a discussion and many, most the vast majority, actually of people that have a suicide ideation do not have any intent or plan to commit suicide.\", \"Absolutely.Yeah.\", \"That, you know, I responsibility to make sure you\\'re safe and I feel like I can do that.\", \"If we talk to Through an issue and you don\\'t have any, any reason to believe you\\'re going to harm yourself, but just had a suicidal thought, okay, okay, that\\'s a lot different than you, you came in to me and told me about detail plan, and you really seem like you\\'re going to do it, then I\\'d be a lot more worried.\", \"So that exception to confidentiality is really used in the most extreme cases of suicidal or homicidal ideation.\", \"Another exception in the state that will let you know about is if I have any reason to believe that a child or an elderly person is being abused.\", \"I have to report it was called a mandated reporter.Now I\\'m sure that you\\'re not abusing anyone or elderly people.\", \"But I want to explain how this exception works because it\\'s a little more far reaching you may think.\", \"So say that you come in and you discuss with me a neighbor, right, that seemingly has nothing to do with your treatment, but just kidding.\", \"I mentioned that something\\'s going on that discussion leads me to believe that your neighbor\\'s abusing their child.\", \"I still have to report that, even though it has really nothing to do with you directly.\", \"It\\'s something you just told me in passing.\", \"I\\'d have to act on it.\", \"Again, I would only release the information necessary to protect a child safety.\", \"Does that make sense?So no matter how I find out about it, or who it is, I have to act on that.And then the last exception I want to review is, again, as with many of these very unlikely, but if for some reason you\\'re involved in any type of civil or criminal litigation, and a judge orders me to testify.\", \"I have to testify.\", \"I can tell you this happens.\", \"Very Rarely, but it can happen.\", \"And I can and will try not to disclose me, I\\'ll ask the judge to not disclose if you don\\'t want me to, but ultimately a judge can order me and I have to.\", \"So in the end, it\\'s up to the judge.\", \"So, again, most of these pretty unlikely, yeah.\", \"But I\\'d rather have all the information going forward so you don\\'t have any concerns about where the information you\\'re revealing or talking about where the information is going.\", \"Okay.\", \"Do you have any questions about that?Okay.\", \"Well, I appreciate you sitting through that.\", \"Talk on confidentiality.\", \"So we\\'re gonna get started now with the assessment.\", \"I know when we met a few weeks ago, you were quite keen to look at some ways to try and manage your depression, maybe without medication.\", \"Is that what brings you in today?\", \"Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And I\\'d like to take some notes if that\\'s okay, just to keep track of what we talked about.\", \"That\\'d be okay with you.\", \"You can have a Coffee to take away afterwards.\", \"And what I find quite helpful is if we talk about a specific situation.\", \"I wonder if you could just think of a time maybe a recent time when you felt particularly depressed and it affected you.right to what was going through your mind when you\\'re feeling tired and low, that stopped you wanting to goAnd what would that mean, if you didn\\'t have anything to say?\", \"It sound like some really difficult thoughts to have and how did it make you feel when you\\'re thinking that ?Okay, it\\'s really understandable.\", \"I think that you\\'d feel low if you\\'re having quite self critical, very negative thoughts and that it\\'s quite common in depression to have those type of thoughts.\", \"Did it make you think anything about how they might see you, for example?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"I\\'m not that that must be really painful.\", \"And how does it make you feel to think that Molly might be better off with one or the other moms?What tells you that Molly might be better off with one or the other moms?You\\'ve mentioned a number of emotional feelings.\", \"You said you feel fed up, low, sad and sometimes guilty.\", \"Do you have any physical symptoms or body reactions?Are you getting good sleep at the moment?rightSo Steph, I know you just want to go home and you don\\'t want to be admitted.\", \"However, I\\'m really concerned that you\\'ve swallowed a whole bottle of pills last night because you were feeling down.\", \"Do you think you\\'re going to do that again?I\\'m still really concerned about you and I need to know that you\\'re going to be safe when you leave here.\", \"I need you to fill out the safety plan to ensure that you have strategies in place to cope when you\\'re feeling down.Well, I think that you do need a plan.\", \"You obviously needed a plan last night when you swallow that whole bottle of pills.\", \"And I want you to fill out the safety plan to ensure you have strategies in place in case you feel like this.\", \"Again, it\\'s a condition of your discharge.this is really concerning for me Steph, perhaps you need to be admitted.So Steph I know you probably want to get out of here and go home and that you don\\'t want to be admitted.\", \"It must have been a really scary experience for you.\", \"I want you to know though that anytime you\\'re feeling unsafe or at risk of harming yourself.\", \"You\\'re always welcome to come back to the emergency department.\", \"I\\'m wondering what you think might have been helpful for you.\", \"If this happens again?Must have been a really hard experience to go through.\", \"Yeah, I\\'m wondering if you think it would be helpful to have some kind of plan in place or some strategies if by chance you feel like this again?\", \"What do you think might be helpful for you to think about or to do if you did feel like this again?Oh, so that\\'s a good idea.\", \"Who do you think you might have called?So it\\'s good.\", \"You have someone in your life that you can talk to.\", \"What do you think stopped you from calling her last night?So you\\'re worried about disturbing them.\", \"I imagine that your aunt Jenny probably would have been okay with you calling her and given the circumstances and how you were feeling.\", \"Do you think you\\'d be okay with maybe having a conversation with her about her being an emergency contact for you?I\\'m wondering maybe if I could bring your dad in right now.\", \"And we could maybe all talk about this together.Okay.Hi, Julie, how are you?\", \"I\\'m Natasha.\", \"Welcome to the service.Nice to meet you, too.\", \"Thank you for coming today.\", \"How did you get here?\", \"Did you travel by car or train?\", \"How did you find the traffic?Oh, that\\'s good.\", \"I was held out there\\'s a big smash on the road so took me a little bit longer.\", \"So I\\'m glad that you\\'re able to make it in.\", \"That\\'s good.Julie, I\\'m glad that you\\'ve made the effort to come in today.\", \"How did you hear about our service?Excellent.\", \"Well, thank you for coming in.\", \"When you came in, you fill out some forms which the girls have given me which is great.\", \"So that gives me a little bit of a background to To where you\\'re from, and things of that nature.\", \"And I just wanted to start by saying that our service is a counseling service for women, and therefore you fit that category, which is really good.\", \"Now I just wanted to let you know that this is our first initial interview, I guess.\", \"So today, we will be just setting some, I\\'ll be hearing some of your story.\", \"And we\\'ll work through a little bit of a process and then I\\'m sure we\\'ll get the opportunity to meet again.\", \"Is that okay?Excellent.\", \"And now within the pack that, that I\\'ve given you or the girls at the front have given you Julie, there is some information on how we keep your privacy and confidentiality.\", \"So I just wanted to clarify that before we go into our session today.\", \"So within the community set, the community center here, we do everything that you say to me today is kept within a confidential environment.\", \"However, I am a mandatory reporter, which means that if you tell me Something that I feel that you may be at risk, or you may be at risk of harm to yourself or hurting someone else.\", \"If you have children, if they may be at risk, or if you\\'re participating in illegal activity.\", \"I am an entry reporter.\", \"And I will need to let somebody know about that so that we can try to get you some help and assistance in dealing with that particular situation.\", \"Is that okay?\", \"Excellent.\", \"So Julie, let\\'s just start by what what is brought you here today?Okay, how long have you been married for?Wow.\", \"Okay.\", \"That\\'s a that\\'s a decent amount of time.\", \"Do you have any children?Okay, so you must be kept busy then?Okay.\", \"And the children today we\\'re about who\\'s looking after them today for you.Excellent.\", \"And where\\'s your husband today?Okay, that\\'s good.\", \"So, it seems as if you\\'re at a point in your marriage where you\\'re feeling as if marriage has changed a little bit in its focused and you\\'re you\\'re kind of a little bit worried about what the future holds for yourself and and your husband?So the alcohol seems to be a problem.\", \"Do you think that might be relating to the changing behavior that you mentioned earlier?Okay.\", \"So that must be difficult for you and the children.\", \"How have you noticed if the children have picked up on the change in his behavior?Okay.\", \"Are the arguments, something that is it over more trivial things?\", \"Or does it sort of other big key things that you\\'re kind of arguing with him about?Okay.\", \"So Julie, have you in terms of his drinking, I\\'m kind of just trying to ascertain maybe what has developed in in your marriage that\\'s taking you to the point that potentially you know, you\\'ve come to see me today.\", \"And it appears as if the drinking is really the focus of perhaps your your feeling of You know, wanting to disconnect from the marriage and feeling isolated within the marriage would that be?\", \"Would that be wrong?Have you spoken to him about this?Potentially, he\\'s not acknowledging then that he may have a drinking problem.\", \"Okay.\", \"I can understand that this must be difficult for you, Julie.\", \"And I\\'m pleased that you\\'ve come here today to try to, you know, work through some of these issues.\", \"Now, Julie, in terms of, I guess, your commitment to the marriage in terms of where you want the marriage, kind of To go, do you think that you have a strong base that you can potentially, you know, if we were able to help your husband with the drinking side of things that it might your marriage itself might be strong enough to overcome and to move forward in the relationship Or, you know, tell me a little bit about what your thoughts are with that?Okay.\", \"Julie, in terms of your own support, you mentioned your mom\\'s looking after the children today, do you would you consider yourself to have friends and family that you know, have you spoken to anyone else about this issue?Have any of those note any of the family or friends noticed a change in your husband\\'s behavior?Okay, so this is impacting on you, as well as the, I guess, the extended family as well.\", \"Well, it\\'s really good to hear that you do have a support network outside of this room, I guess, which is really, really good and it\\'s great that you\\'ve got that and I\\'d encourage you to use your mom and your family and friends, you know, as a gentle ear to listen to, you know, to help you support yourself and the children through this, this phase or this stage in your relationship with your husband.\", \"So, Julie, I\\'m just trying to think about potentially you, just to recap, So you\\'re saying that your relationship with your husband has changed from what it was.\", \"You\\'ve been with him for about eight years, and you have got three children.\", \"You\\'ve mentioned that the primary changes his behavior, and that you believe that it probably is linked to his changing drinking habits.\", \"And from what I understand you\\'ve expressed that you would be happy to potentially work with him to resolve or seek help for him in relation to his drinking habits.\", \"How do you would that be right what I\\'ve said?Not knowing your husband, I guess I would probably need to ask you if Do you think that your husband would be receptive to Maybe some marriage counseling or going to see somebody about his drinking.\", \"Is he the type of person that might be receptive to that?\", \"OrOkay.\", \"That\\'s positive.\", \"That\\'s really good.\", \"Because some people that I meet, you know that the answer to that would be quite different.\", \"So I think that\\'s really positive for you, Julie.\", \"I think what we probably need to look at now is is maybe continuing this relationship between you and I.\", \"So I\\'d love to see you again and meet up with you again, but also to I think we probably need to explore that avenue of, of either getting you some marriage counseling or something along those lines, as well as seeing whether or not your husband might be interested in in looking at some services to help him with his his drinking issues that he has So if it\\'s okay by you, what we might do from here is organized for us to meet again.\", \"What time is best for you?Okay, so what we\\'ll do is we\\'ll we\\'ll organize maybe for this time next week, and we\\'ll meet again, but in the meantime, I think we probably need to put you in contact with the relationships counselor.\", \"And we\\'ll try to get that side of things going.\", \"And as a result of that, we\\'ll be able to work out how receptive Your husband is of, of potentially seeking some help for him as well.\", \"I would like to just say that you mentioned that you you probably would like to escape a little bit from it at the moment.\", \"So perhaps I might be able to give you some advice or some some information on you know, some things that you might be able to do to take yourself away from that situation, if you feel as if you know, it\\'s a little bit too much, maybe you might like to tap into your mom or your family and friends as well, if you don\\'t feel comfortable using some of the other services in the area.\", \"How do you feel about that?Okay.\", \"Well, thank you, Julie, for taking the time.\", \"I\\'m really happy that you were able to come in today.\", \"And it\\'s, I look forward to going on this journey with you.\", \"It\\'s not a solution.\", \"We can\\'t, you know, fix everything here today.\", \"It will be a process and but you know, hopefully together, you know, we can see a really positive outcome for you and your family.I look forward to seeing you next week.Am I doing today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thank you for asking.\", \"I understand you\\'ve been having some symptoms that have been bothering you lately.Can you?\", \"Can you tell me about that?Someone someone was robbed.\", \"near where you live.How long does it take you to fall back to sleep?And what are you thinking about during that time?That sounds scary.And you said a couple hours to stay away.Yeah.\", \"Soyeah.\", \"So this is this is troubling for you.\", \"Have you ever gotten up and check the door?So you just keep thinking about it.\", \"Does it get worse as the time goes on?\", \"Or does it get better?\", \"What happens?So keep cycling through the sameDo you ever do anything to try to get those thoughts to go away like focusing on something else?Right?\", \"So you have have a fear that somebody is going to enter break in To where you live, and you\\'re staying up at night thinking about whether the doors been secured.\", \"That\\'s been that\\'s been troubling.\", \"Anything else?What do you think  happen?So when you leave, you\\'re thinking about it was a hairspray Are you thinking about whether you unplugged it or not?\", \"Or turn it off or not?And how long those thoughts go on for?Alright, so remember with the door you\\'re saying that you you struggle with those thoughts, but you don\\'t get up and check the door.\", \"Have you ever come back and checked to see if something was left on?So you\\'re worried anxiousYeah, afraid?And how, how often does this happen?\", \"Like the cycle of thoughts?So every day?And how long has this been going on?this specific a yearAnd in that year timeframe hasn\\'t become any worse.Yeah.\", \"How did it start out?I should as you thought about it.All right, I want to ask a few other questions, try to help me figure out what\\'s going on.\", \"Have you ever been diagnosed with any condition like a mental health condition?Have a medical condition?Have you ever used alcohol or any other substances?And is this been the first time in your life you\\'ve experienced these symptoms?\", \"Starting a year ago up till now?Yeah, never anything like this before.I\\'m going to get you in to see one of our counselors here.I appreciate you spending this time with me.\", \"It\\'s been helpful for me to try to understand what\\'s going on.ThanksMr.\", \"Smith that your medication sorted out, blood pressure\\'s a little on the high side.\", \"Okay.\", \"I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weightI wondered if we could spend just a couple of hours minutes talking about your weightRight.\", \"And you so you\\'re busy enough?Yeah, you know, and it wasn\\'t necessarily easy for you to make the time to come down.\", \"And you had to wait in the waiting room.\", \"And now are raised the subject of wait.\", \"right.\", \"And so it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s been a bit of a rush for you coming in.\", \"And I\\'m sorry about the wait in the waiting room.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s and that\\'s not easy for you because you, you\\'d like to go really soon.\", \"And here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me.Exactly, exactly.\", \"It\\'s up to you.\", \"Just a couple of minutes.I promise.\", \"Okay.\", \"I want to, I want to simply ask you how you feel about it?Right.\", \"So you can see the links between your weights and your health.\", \"And you\\'d like things to be.you\\'d like to, if you could.ready meals and that sort of thing?Let me see if I can summarize what you\\'ve said.\", \"And then we\\'ll see what next and you lead a busy life.\", \"Yeah, you run a business.\", \"And you\\'ve got a lot to do.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And you\\'re, you\\'re aware of the of the links between your health and your weight.\", \"And you are concerned to some extent about that.\", \"And ideally, it sounds like you\\'d like to do something about it.\", \"It\\'s just that your life is busy and rushed.\", \"And you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done.I get it, I get it.\", \"And so if you could fit it in, you would like things to be different, but that\\'s not so easy.\", \"Okay.\", \"Can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about this?exactly I tell you what my Be a nice solution is if you come down first appointment, and I give you an appointment at 830.\", \"And then there\\'ll be absolutely no waiting.\", \"And the purpose of that of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work like that you\\'ve gotgood good and see if you can fix it up and also give some thought to what we\\'ve talked about.Hi Lacey Nice to meet you.So I understand that you refer to her by your GP because you\\'ve been feeling quite down recently.Okay, so from your notes, I saw that you saw the GP about three months ago and how long have you been feeling down all together?Okay, so as it got worse since you saw your GP?okay so tell me I\\'m How are things at the moment?Okay, so you said that you\\'re feeling really down really sad?\", \"Yeah.\", \"And you feel like you haven\\'t got any motivation.\", \"Are you okay?\", \"Okay, and you haven\\'t got any motivation, but it sounds like you put in quite a lot of pressure on yourself to try and feel a bit better.so you say you\\'ve been, you\\'ve been in quite isolated.\", \"There\\'s not many people around.\", \"Okay, so I\\'m just going to try and find out a little bit more about you.\", \"So I understand that you\\'re an English student at Uni.\", \"And you live away from home with some friends.\", \"Is that right?Okay, so you don\\'t live any far from the Uni.\", \"But you say you feel like University friends, but you don\\'t feel like you can talk to them?Okay, so it sounds to try and hide the way you\\'re feeling from them.\", \"Okay, so it sounds like you\\'ve been feeling down, you\\'ve been feeling unmotivated.\", \"You feel like you want to be better, but actually, it sounds like you felt like you can\\'t reach out for help.\", \"You can\\'t speak speak to anybody.\", \"Okay, I\\'m just gonna go back in time a little bit, I suppose, I\\'m just wondering when when did all of this start?\", \"You said it\\'s been going on for quite a few months.\", \"Okay, so this would be like last March last April?Around that time, so about six months if and it sounds like a lot was happening so you had a lot of uni pressure on and you said that your parents were having marital problems?\", \"Okay, and it sounds like that was a real shock to you.Okay, so it sounds like you were trying to work hard and be more successful because you thought that that would make them happier and try and fix things.\", \"How did it backfire?Okay, so after the summer, after the exam period, and how did that exam period go for you in the end?\", \"Okay, there\\'s an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself, you suppose So you say, I know, I know, I should have done better.\", \"I mean, I suppose that hearing it from my perspective, I\\'m thinking it sounds like you had an awful lot going on.\", \"At the time.\", \"It\\'d be understandable, absolutely, that you wouldn\\'t do as well as normal.\", \"I suppose.\", \"I\\'m just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself.So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And that there is any kind of exceptions for that?Okay.\", \"So I can, I can see that that was a really difficult time for you and that was when your mood started to get lower.\", \"And things are still quite bad now.\", \"I mean, what\\'s the situation with your parents at the moment?The may be  this summer ?and how was that?Okay.\", \"Okay, so it sounds like quite a lot has been happening you\\'ve been feeling very low you\\'ve had uni pressure on, and we\\'ve had problems with your parents marriage and sounds like you feel that you can\\'t really reach out to anyone mate, you can\\'t understand we can\\'t really reach out to your parents right now.\", \"You can\\'t really confide in your friends.\", \"So I suppose I\\'m just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you\\'ve been feeling.\", \"I mean, say this past week.Right.\", \"So I suppose I\\'m just wondering and let\\'s see if we can think about one thing, say a lecture on, what kind of thoughts do you have about going to a lecture before it happens?Okay, so it sounds like the kind of thoughts you\\'ve got in your head are, it\\'s pointless, and it\\'s not worth it.\", \"Do you have any other thoughts in your head when you\\'re just at that point before you go to the lecture?So it sounds like you feel like you\\'re not as good as other people here.Okay.\", \"I\\'m just as far as Okay, if I take notes as we go through is just, I\\'m trying to, I guess understand what you\\'re telling me and it helps me to write it down and I\\'ll share this with you later.\", \"Okay, so it sounds like those are those are some quite negative thoughts to have.\", \"You\\'re kind of saying, you know, it feels like it\\'s pointless, It\\'s more effort thaaftern it\\'s worth.\", \"And I don\\'t deserve to be here.\", \"I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel?Okay, so what you described that you said, I\\'m unworthy, I should be doing lots of things better.\", \"And those are kind of what I would call thoughts Actually, I suppose I\\'m trying to understand what it feels like in your gut.\", \"What kind of emotions do you feel happier?\", \"Do you feel sad?\", \"What kind of emotions you\\'re feeling when you have those thoughts?Okay.\", \"I just when you kind of tell me this, and I know this is quite heavy topic.\", \"But you\\'re kind of laughing and I suppose I wonder a little bit of your a bit.\", \"You know, how do you feel about having these emotions?\", \"Talking about these emotions?\", \"Well, you\\'re doing a great job because I know I know that this can be difficult.\", \"Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you\\'re describing are, it\\'s pointless, it\\'s more than it\\'s worth.\", \"I don\\'t deserve to be here.\", \"I\\'m unworthy.\", \"And those kind of thoughts.\", \"It sounds like they just flit through your mind.\", \"And then he\\'s kind of describing different emotions that those lead to kind of screaming sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed.\", \"What about in your body?\", \"What happens?\", \"How do you feel kind of physically?So it sounds like this is affecting, it\\'s draining you of your energy, like, like your body can\\'t be bothered.\", \"I think that\\'s a really good way of describing it.\", \"And you\\'re noticing sleep problems as well.\", \"And then what do you do?\", \"So this is so we\\'re back to the point before the lecture.\", \"So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and you know your body, I guess it sounds like those thoughts quite draining.\", \"So be draining your energy, what then happens what you do next?So you think even more about those kind of warnings that you have to do a bit of dwelling any say in bed.\", \"And it sounds like you don\\'t, you haven\\'t tried speaking to your friends about it.\", \"Okay, and then after you\\'ve done that, so after you\\'ve not gone to the lecture, you\\'ve stayed in bed, you kind of spent time As you said, focusing on those those thoughts, those negative thoughts, how do you feel after that to feel better?\", \"Or do you feel worse?So it sounds like in some ways, it\\'s a bit of a relief to do that, But in other ways, maybe you think it might make things worse,Hello Kelly, how are you doing today?Thanks for coming in for the Cintiq.\", \"I know you\\'ve gone through the screening process at your agency before.\", \"Yeah, they ask you variety questions like there are 40 questions.\", \"Like your social security number, date of birth, other information they need to carry out billing and different administrative functions.\", \"But the purpose of this intake today is much different.\", \"I\\'m gonna be asking much more personal questions.\", \"Specifically related to things that happening in your life and your symptoms.\", \"You\\'re comfortable with them?Okay.\", \"Before I get started with the first section, I want to talk a little bit about confidentiality.\", \"When you see a counselor for treatment, the communication that you have with that counselor is confidential, but there\\'s this big asterisk next to the word confidential.\", \"Okay.\", \"And I want to explain to the certain circumstances under which confidentiality might be broken.\", \"So, so let\\'s start at, everything\\'s confidential.\", \"And then I\\'ll explain the exceptions to you, like make sense.\", \"Okay.\", \"The probably the largest exception.\", \"One of the most frequently used exceptions is if you sign a release, for me to break confidentiality, this is not uncommon.\", \"For example, if you want me to talk to your physician because a physical condition or medication you\\'re taking could be affecting your mood.\", \"you might sign a release that allows me to communicate with your physician.\", \"Oftentimes, the physician will require the same thing.\", \"So that should be two releases, okay, one that he or she keeps, and one that I keep.\", \"Okay.\", \"Similarly, if you have a family member, that you want to bring in for a session, because somehow it might be related to what\\'s going on with you, you would have to sign a release.\", \"If you did That I then could communicate with that family member.\", \"Does that make sense?Even though releases have to be in writing to be in effect, except in extreme circumstances, you can discontinue release at anytime I call an agency and tell them that you want your release canceled.\", \"So say that, you know, I have no reasonably this is the case.\", \"Let\\'s say you have a family member that comes in and there\\'s a session and it goes, Okay.\", \"But then your relationship with that family member breaks down at a point.\", \"And now you think well, I don\\'t want them calling in and being able to talk to your counselor.\", \"All you have to do is call in and the administrative staff will cancel that.\", \"If you do that, that\\'s fine.\", \"But also next time you see me Tell me and I\\'ll double check and make sure that it\\'s been cancelled in your chart.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Okay.\", \"Another exception to confidentiality is what\\'s called cognitive care, meaning you\\'re here at agency and you\\'re seeing me, but a lot of other people work here and have some investment or duties related to your care.\", \"For example, somebody has to follow the charts.\", \"Somebody has to do the billing.\", \"There\\'s a director to this agency, right, that has an interest in your care as well.\", \"So I\\'m permitted to speak to those individuals about things that we talk about.\", \"I only do so to the extent that I need to, for example, from talking to a person in billing, I\\'m not going to tell them about deep dark secrets you may have in your life, history or something, right.\", \"I\\'m going to talk about what they need to know which is usually what type of insurance does she have?\", \"Or is there a change in insurance is coming or something like that kind of questions are asking me aren\\'t typically a personal nature.\", \"And if they were, I wouldn\\'t answer them.\", \"However, with the director of the agency, that would be a different level of disclosure.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Because they\\'re a clinical and they\\'re a clinical person.I could, I generally would try to avoid that But if you know there\\'s a a treatment team meeting, and your particular case was being discussed, then, you know, other clinicians and the director would have access to information now they\\'re bound by the same rules of confidentiality, but I\\'m bound by okay.\", \"We do this because it promotes good care.\", \"So we have information that you voluntarily release, right cognitive care another exception is if I have reason to believe that you\\'re going to harm somebody.\", \"It\\'s called a tarifs of duty.\", \"Right?\", \"It\\'s a duty to warn.\", \"So again, I imagine this is why.\", \"I know this is unlikely in general.\", \"And your specific case, I imagine it\\'s unlikely.\", \"But if you were to tell me that you were going to harm somebody, and then you left this office, I would have to contact them and warn them that you\\'re on your way to harm.\", \"Again, this wouldn\\'t involve disclosing a family secrets and all kinds of diagnoses.\", \"This would just be Hey, Kelly coming out to harm you.\", \"Okay, and I\\'m warning you, and you should probably do something about that, like call the police or flee.\", \"Yeah, I think again, I want to cover these things.\", \"They\\'re oftentimes not used, but that\\'s one of those rare things that has happened in the past, I don\\'t imagine having by one time about it anyway.Another exception to confidentiality is if I believe that, in general, you\\'re a danger to yourself or others, meaning without a specific target in mind, you\\'re, I feel that I have evidence to support that you\\'re going to be a danger to someone else or the public in general, or a danger to yourself.\", \"I have to and I have the ability to, an authority to take steps to prevent you from harming yourself or somebody else.\", \"I\\'ll only disclose what information I need to to prevent you from harming yourself or somebody else.\", \"And the same would apply in the case if you had been threatened harm somebody else.So I want to emphasize at this point, that if you tell me that you have suicidal thoughts or homicidal thoughts, that doesn\\'t necessarily mean law enforcement or inpatient facilities are going to be involved.\", \"Okay, we can talk about it.\", \"And a lot of people, especially if they have any type of depression, have suicidal thoughts.\", \"It\\'s extremely common, and homicidal thoughts are actually fairly common as well.\", \"Rarely are they acted upon, but they\\'re common thoughts.\", \"So I want you to feel free to discuss those without fear that I\\'m just going to reach up the phone and call the police because that\\'s not gonna be the case.\", \"But if there\\'s a clear threat, and I\\'m really worried then I will act and all this is actually to protect you and the public.The the another exception to confidentiality is if you provide information to me that leads me to believe a child or an elderly person is being abused.\", \"Now, interestingly, with this exception, it doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re the abuser or not.\", \"You could tell me about your neighbor, and how on your way to therapy, you saw that person abused their child tben I will actually report that.\", \"And again, I\\'m just giving the information they need to try to prevent any harm to the child or does it make sense?\", \"Okay, and the last thing exception and confidentiality would be and this is very rare, but it can happen.\", \"So I want to tell you about it.\", \"If for some reason, during the course of this therapy or even after this therapy has terminated, you get involved with the civil legal system in the criminal legal system, and a judge orders me to disclose information from your chart or from our experiences, okay.\", \"Technically, a judge can do that, and I\\'ll have to follow his or her orders.\", \"Before I would make a such disclosure, I would certainly make my case to the judge, that I don\\'t want to make that disclosure and try to restrict that disclosure as much as possible.\", \"But in the end, it\\'s important to know that I don\\'t have the power to make the final decision, it would be in the hands of a judge.\", \"Again, this happens very rarely, but I do on but you know, there\\'s an exception to confidentiality.\", \"Do you understand all those as I\\'m describing to you?And you have any questions about any of those?we\\'re gonna have a discussion about that.\", \"Yeah, I\\'m not gonna, okay.\", \"I don\\'t have the authority actually to lock anybody.\", \"Yeah, all I could do is to, well, the first thing I would do is assess the seriousness, and we\\'ll try to work out some sort of safety plan that we can both be happy with.\", \"Okay, and that keeps you safe.\", \"But in terms of the extreme, whereas you said, Look, I really, you know, I\\'m going to harm myself and I\\'m going to do it soon.\", \"And here\\'s I\\'m going to do it.\", \"My recourse would be to call law enforcement and they have a variety of options that are available to them.\", \"Of course, one is taking into an inpatient facility or something like that.\", \"Sometimes they arrive in Scituate is changed by then all kinds of possibilities.\", \"That\\'s really a move of last resort.\", \"That\\'s not going to be my first call.\", \"My first or my first action, my first action is going to be communicating with you and seeing where we are.\", \"And it\\'s not unusual that clients have suicidal ideation to some degree for many sessions in a row.\", \"Right?\", \"no, particularly with any type of depressive disorder, or even just feelings of depression that don\\'t rise to that diagnostic level.\", \"It\\'s not uncommon to have passive suicidal ideation, like maybe wishing that you wouldn\\'t wake up the next day or something.\", \"That\\'s a lot different than you telling me that you have a plan to harm yourself and that you\\'re going to do it.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Any Other questions about those limits of confidentiality.If you\\'re ever at a point where you\\'re unsure, you don\\'t remember what they are, of course, they\\'re included in the information received screening, and there\\'s a sheet that had them on there.\", \"But feel free to ask me about them.\", \"Right.\", \"And I\\'ll be happy to clarify any points, anything that you might have forgot from now until that point, and I\\'ll be happy to explain it again.\", \"All right.\", \"So let\\'s move to the next step.\", \"Let\\'s go with youI\\'m going to be asking you questions from a wide variety of domains.\", \"subject matters, like relational history, emotional history.\", \"So certain areas, you may want to talk about more than others and I\\'ll make a note of that.\", \"But I don\\'t want to get too in depth in terms of any therapy at this point, because this is me trying to collect data.\", \"This is like a data collection stage.\", \"So this sets the framework and structure for what we\\'re doing later on part of it.\", \"But I understand that some of the topics I bring up you may want to expand upon.\", \"So if that happens, I\\'m probably just going to point you back toward what we\\'re doing.\", \"But I\\'ll make a note here to make sure we cover later.\", \"Kind of makes sense?Okay, ready, get started.\", \"All right.\", \"What brings you in to our agency?\", \"What\\'s been bothering?So you\\'re saying you\\'re a little down, but you\\'re also having some relational difficulties with people that you work with.Okay, we\\'ll talk about that some more.\", \"Any feelings of anxiety?Worried nervous on edge, anything?So I\\'m going to ask you some questions, call this a symptom checklist.\", \"Many of these likely will not apply to you.\", \"I like to cover everything in the section, regardless.\", \"Okay.\", \"So as I touch on a topic, like the first one is memory loss.\", \"Okay.\", \"As I touch on a topic, let me know if it\\'s happening currently.\", \"If it\\'s happened, or if you\\'ve noticed it in the last 30 days, if it\\'s ever happened, okay, so we have current last month or so three days ever happened or if it\\'s never happened, right.\", \"If you need me to remind you those four categories, just let me knowso current last three days ever happened or never happened.\", \"Okay, so we\\'ll start with memory loss.\", \"Have you having memory loss currently?\", \"Or the last three days or ever?Yeah.\", \"any substance related problems or issues?you tell me it happened?Okay.\", \"And we\\'ll talk about any type of legal problems later on.\", \"So there\\'s been some substance related issues, but nothing doesn\\'t sound like it\\'s it\\'s troubling now.We\\'ll talk about that a little bit.\", \"When\\'s the last time you had a drink?Have you ever had any withdrawal symptoms?Have you ever heard term auditory hallucinations?\", \"It means when somebody hears things that other people can\\'t hear.\", \"you\\'ve ever had that happenvi?vsualizations are the same thing except for seeing.\", \"They\\'re seeing things who have not seen?Have you ever felt like or been told that you have any type of delusions or paranoia?Nothing like that.\", \"Okay.\", \"Have you ever felt like your thoughts are disorganized?You mentioned you\\'re feeling little down, Have you ever felt Really up, we call manic.\", \"Like they have a lot of energy and don\\'t sleep for days at a time anything like that.How about racing thoughts?\", \"in general, is your mood fairly stable?\", \"Or does it ever go from one extreme to the other?\", \"Does that ever happen?\", \"We call that lay bottom mood.Okay.\", \"How about irritability?Have you ever had trouble with sleeping?When\\'s the last time you had trouble sleeping?ever find yourself having obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors/like repetitive thoughts, creating anxiety or behaviors you just can\\'t seem to stop doingYou mentioned some some sleep problems have a problem nightmares.Okay.\", \"have very high trouble with the amount of food you eat, like, too little food, too much food, anything like that?You feel like you\\'re not eating enough.This has been a problem recently and currently a food banks problem gone.Just interested in food.\", \"Okay.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So do you feel like you are now or have been a danger than anyone else?Okay.\", \"Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?Well, we\\'ll touch on that a little later on.\", \"how about suicidal plan, ever plan have an attempt or So some occasional thoughts?a long time ago?What was the last suicidal thought?Have you ever harmed yourself?\", \"called self mutilation for example, cutting?We have talked about dangerousness you said never been in danger.\", \"Have you ever had any homicidal thoughts?Hmmhave you ever been violent?\", \"Like have a violent outburst or something like that?fineIt\\'s a rare?Okay, so I\\'ve completed symptom checklist.\", \"Obviously, there\\'s some areas in here we\\'ll talk about a little later on, too.\", \"But it gives me a good overview of kind of what\\'s going on on one page.\", \"So I want to switch gears a little bit to recall trauma screening.\", \"All right.\", \"So I\\'m gonna ask you, have you ever been exposed and the following incidents on the list different types of incidents?\", \"Okay.\", \"Just because you say yes, doesn\\'t necessarily mean there\\'s a trauma associated, but still important for me to doubt if this had happened to.\", \"Have you ever been involved in a motor vehicle accident?How about a firework accident?you\\'ve been the victim of a crime?we\\'ll come back to that.\", \"If you\\'re having any kind of weather related trauma like the fall, tornado or flood or anythingever have flashbacks?have been physically abused?You don\\'t seem quite sure on that?How often that happen?Hoe about about sexual abuse?how about a traumatic loss like seeing somebody die in front of you or something like that?And domestic violence, we sort of talked about that and you\\'re saying you mostly argue, any physical components were thereOkay.\", \"So can you tell me a little bit about the motor vehicle accident?those who might do to shake up about it now?How about the you mentioned you\\'re a victim of a crime.\", \"Tell me briefly about that?And have that result like what was the result of that?Does your car repair?So I appreciate answering those questions related to potential trauma and I switch gears a little bit into substance abuse.\", \"I know you touched on this earlier a little bit, You mentioned the sound like involvement with the law about the marijuana so at one time, you used marijuana.\", \"How long did you use marijuana for?How about alchohol?That\\'s correct?Have you ever found yourself in any trouble because of alcohol use like do you lie or being so intoxicated that you did something you regretted anything like that?Due to alcohol?do you think you have a problem with alcohol?If you had to stop using entirely Would you be able to?but  you could?How about befor the marijuana same thing?And the other substances you like Tell me about?and no use since then?All right.\", \"Have you ever been treated for substance abuse?So let\\'s switch gears again to gambling.\", \"Have you ever gamble?Tell me about that.Okay.\", \"Can you tell us about your experience when you have gone?\", \"From Sure.\", \"gambling and what happened?Okay.\", \"So you feel you have a gambling problem.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Thank you.\", \"I want to switch gears again, I want to talk about any previous treatment history have ever seen.\", \"a counselor, a type of mental health clinician, or a psychiatrist?\", \"Anybody like that before?Do you remember what year?How long did you see the counselor?So what what happened of course that too much?Okay, can you tell me how you terminated treatment?\", \"Did you cancel appointment and that was it or did you have obsession where you wrap things up with them?stop going?So it sounds like the reason that you didn\\'t continue treatment was you didn\\'t feel the counselor Really wasn\\'t doing that great job felt secure and confident.It\\'s not uncommon throughout the course of someone\\'s treatment, that they\\'re treated by a counselor, mental health clinician, they don\\'t quite become in sync with like this.\", \"That\\'s not uncommon.\", \"Like, like you\\'ve recognizing that, perhaps she didn\\'t understand you quite well.\", \"That\\'s not uncommon.\", \"But what I like to do in our counseling relationship is if you feel that\\'s the case, if you communicate that to me, and we can talk about thatWas there any other mental health treatment you\\'ve ever received?\", \"Either inpatient, outpatient?after the onset of marijuana?so it kind of got mandated?I\\'m going to switch gears again and move to the next section.\", \"Are you still okay to continue?Okay, so I\\'m gonna ask you some questions about your developmental history.\", \"Some of these you might have already answered during the screening, but it\\'s important I catch them here as well.\", \"Okay.\", \"What city and state you were born in?and how about which city and state you were raised in?Okay.\", \"Do you speak any other languages other than EnglishTell me who raised you?biologic parents?At any point during childhood, have you ever raised by anybody else temporarily?\", \"can you tell me briefly what your life was like growing up.not so much toward you?No, please go onSo the family dynamic you\\'re speaking about when did that change or hasn\\'t changed?What age should you move out of your parents?should be at around 19Okay, we talked about this a little bit earlier about how your, your experiences when you\\'re young.\", \"How are you disciplined as a childHe didn\\'t get involved in the discipline component.I want to move on now to relationship history.\", \"So I going to switching gears a little bit again.\", \"You mentioned you\\'re married.\", \"Have you been married before?and  he is supportive of that?At some point and I don\\'t know this yet, but at some point, if appropriate, He\\'d be willing to come in for a session with you?How long have you been married?and Where do they live?\", \"Like what do you?every day?I think you mentioned earlier you\\'ve ever had traumatic loss, you haven\\'t lost a child.Can you describe your relationship with your children to me?into round school?You mentioned you have a daughter I know you talked earlier about your relationship with your mother.\", \"Do you see any of that?\", \"What happened there playing out between you and your daughter?Okay.\", \"Anything else abut you told me what Tell mehe\\'s okay now?Had you worried a bit though?I\\'m going to switch gears again.\", \"Are you still come from moving forward?Alright, so I\\'m gonna be asking you some questions about your social situation and what you do in your leisure time.\", \"How do you currently spend your day?That\\'s a fairly typical day for you.What do you do for fun?Why don\\'t you think you enjoy those things?\", \"Now as much as you did?Do you think that this change in your mood is related to what you\\'re talking about before with the problems at work and the relationship there.\", \"You feel like it\\'s all tied together?You know, which came first?\", \"Like what you\\'re describing here with the not having much energy or the difficulty at work?Who are the most important people in your life?\", \"And before you answer that, I\\'m going to guess that you\\'re Husband your kids for occlusion so outside of them unless they\\'re not but it sounds like oh yeah, but outside of them because we are talking about them.\", \"Who are the most important people in your life?\", \"How long?So all the people you just listed when you have difficulties problems when things aren\\'t going well do you feel like you can talk to these people?Okay, I\\'m going to switch gears again.\", \"I want to talk about spirituality.\", \"Can you describe any spiritual you might have and how they affect your life?Okay, Are you affiliated with any religious institution?Can you describe to me how socio or social cultural influences like your values, beliefs and culture have affected your life?Do you identify with a particular ethnicity?Italiam American ?that influenced your life anyway?Okay, I\\'m going to switch gears again.\", \"I want to talk about your educational history.\", \"can tell me your highest level of education?one year of graduate school?And when was the last time you attended a school?Okay.\", \"So if you went to graduate school, I\\'m going to assume that you have a bachelor\\'s of some type.\", \"Yeah.\", \"What\\'s your degree in?Anything else in terms of like special training or education you have?Did you enjoy school?You ever envision going back to school?The graduate degree?Okay.\", \"Do you have any military history?Now I want to talk about your employment history.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So you mentioned that talk about how it currently spend your day that you work your full time?What type of company you work for?and what do you do for them?Okay.\", \"How long you been thereYou enjoy the work?Not not that difficult?Are you in any danger of losing your job?\", \"Because what\\'s going on with you now?So they\\'ve been your employer for last 10 years.\", \"You just have one job right now, right?Okay.\", \"Who is your player prior to that?How long were you there?And what did you do for them?And why did you leave that bank?was that also easy as you Describedany work history prior to that?a few different places?Okay.\", \"All the work you\\'ve done what type of work you enjoyed the best?See, you don\\'t feel satisfied.\", \"I wanted to hear what you\\'d prefer or to your education or anything like that.So seems daunting.So you\\'re tired with your time with your child right now.\", \"So you thought of going through all the effort of finding something new.\", \"It\\'s intimidating.\", \"We touched on this area earlier.\", \"I\\'m going to shift gears again to legal involvement.\", \"You mentioned some legal history when we were going through the symptom checklist.\", \"And if I remember correctly, it sounded involvement marijuana and paid when you\\'re in college.Police were called what happened that night?You mean the offense like, you know, I have a criminal record.Does it ever caused you problems?So as we get Near the end of this intake, and we move toward the regular sessions, you know, the the 53 minutes sessions or however long you know, they\\'ll be that you would typically think of anything of therapy.\", \"Right?\", \"We will talk about goals on off during those sessions.\", \"Okay, those meetings in detail in an actually completed treatment plan that include your goals and objectives to meet those goals.\", \"But before we get into that detailed plan, and we\\'ll actually take the better part of a session to review that and built that treatment plan.\", \"I\\'d like to get a general idea of your goals.\", \"Now I kind of know what you\\'re wanting to describe.\", \"I have an idea of your presenting problems.\", \"What are your What are your general goals with therapy?Can you remember a time when you didn\\'t feel this way?even last year?okayOkay, tell me about your strengths.\", \"What do you do?\", \"good cook, do you think you\\'re funny?Things have changed markedly on that in that department?Wow, that\\'s a lot of strengths.\", \"So we\\'re almost done with intake today.\", \"Right?\", \"We\\'ll be starting the regular sessions later starting next week.\", \"You can set that appointment up front.\", \"Okay.\", \"We\\'ll find something that works for your scheduling and for mine.\", \"Before we wrap up, you remember earlier in the intake, you mentioned that you had some suicidal thoughts within the last 30 days, such indicated and I told you that we will come back to that.\", \"So, I want to touch on that briefly before we break for the day.\", \"Can you tell me about the suicidal ideations that you\\'re having?\", \"So kind of a passive suicidal thinking process.\", \"You don\\'t have any intent to harm yourself?\", \"Or any plan to harm youself.Are you sure?Okay.\", \"There\\'s a term we use in counseling called contracting for safety.\", \"Right?\", \"What that means is that you can essentially Promise me that you\\'re going to be safe.\", \"You know, at least in our next session, but really it\\'s for the foreseeable future.\", \"Right.\", \"So can you contract for safety?What would you do if these suicidal thoughts started become more pronounced?\", \"Let\\'s make a plan around that.\", \"I\\'m not predicting or hoping to take will and I don\\'t have any reasonably they will, but I want to be prepared.\", \"I want you to be prepared just in case sometimes have these thoughts that kind of imagine that sometimes you\\'re not thinking about them at all and other times are a little stronger.\", \"So if they get if they get stronger, if there\\'s a market change in them, Okay, so it comes less passive and more.\", \"You start thinking about a plan or something like that.\", \"Tell me what you would do?You said you can call  call your sister or your husband and say they weren\\'t available as we\\'ve kind of move up, like to the plan.All right.\", \"Those are all good good ideas.\", \"Say you weren\\'t successful at that level because you couldn\\'t get ahold of those individuals.\", \"And the thoughts were persisting What else could you do what other remedies to have available toI think that that\\'s a good place to start family supports.\", \"And usually that works out fairly well, because you typically get a hold of one of those people.\", \"If let me say this if the suicidal thoughts changed dramatically, to where you feel in danger for your life like you, you\\'re really seriously contemplating it.\", \"Yeah.\", \"All right, call 911.Less than that though, meaning they just get a bit worse.\", \"Use your supports.\", \"You can try and get ahold of me if I\\'m available.\", \"I\\'ll get back to you.\", \"And if I\\'m not available, they might feel attracted to a counselor here that is.\", \"But again, if for some reason, every remedy attempt is unsuccessful.\", \"You can\\'t get through.\", \"You can always go directly to an inpatient facility.\", \"Right?\", \"or call 911.\", \"does seem like relatively extreme measures, but losing your life would be more extreme.\", \"But I want to emphasize most of the time getting in touch with family and getting supports around you House a lot.\", \"Okay, so the first call 911 would only be if it\\'s if it really gets dramatically worse from where it is now.\", \"Okay, that makes sense.\", \"Last thing I want to talk to you about before we have our first session is I want to Well, I want to thank you for coming into that.\", \"Right.\", \"And I know that I know that these intakes are relatively dry.\", \"I mean, you\\'re talking I\\'m writing when I\\'m taking down information.\", \"It\\'s very helpful for me, though, for your treatment later on.\", \"But I realize it\\'s not the traditional understanding most clients have counseling.\", \"Just supplying data to the counselor all the time, right?\", \"We\\'ll get to the I guess you could say quote unquote, real sessions when we start next time.\", \"But I want to thank you for being patient through this process.\", \"It really will help us to get more valuable you to get more value out of those sessions.\", \"And I want to encourage you, I know that from what you said in the intake, that you\\'re feeling down, if like you\\'re relating well to your coworkers, it\\'s it appears that you\\'re disappointing yourself and how you\\'re relating to your children and your husband.\", \"Like, not a good mom, not a good spouse.\", \"All all these thoughts are understandable in the context of being down or maybe depressed, right?\", \"If that\\'s what\\'s going on, it sounds like that is what could be going on.\", \"We\\'ll figure it out as we, as we move through and work toward a diagnosis.\", \"But as you commit to therapy, and as you come in for counseling regularly, I hope that these symptoms would improve.\", \"And oftentimes they do, obviously, I can\\'t guarantee it, but oftentimes they do.\", \"So I want to, I want you to recognize that it\\'s a value to be hopeful, and to look forward to good things.\", \"And to realize you take a big step by coming here today.\", \"And it was difficult and it wasn\\'t easy by answering all these questions rehashing all these things.\", \"And the work of counseling itself is challenging times.\", \"But I do think it\\'s worth it.\", \"If it has a good chance it does, of improving how you feel.\", \"So I want to applaud your commitments that encourage you to attend the first session and attend every session and really work through this process.\", \"Do you have any questions for me before we end today?If you should have any questions to rise, I know for me, I always think of the best questions after I leave.\", \"You know, if I\\'m in an environment where I\\'m supposed to ask questions, and somebody says that, it\\'s always when I get my car that I remember them.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So if that happens to you, feel free to give me a call and leave a message.\", \"And I\\'ll be happy to get back to you with an answer as soon as I can.\", \"So I look forward to seeing you next week then.\", \"Thanks againRight Carmelo, want to take a couple of minutes and go over the skill and anger that you filled out when you got here, you had mentioned that some people in your life have kind of commented and they said, you know, maybe you want to look into thinking about whether or not you have some issues with anger or not.\", \"And that\\'s one of the reasons you\\'re here.\", \"And I\\'m hoping that this will help sort of identify specific issues related to anger that might be problematic for you.\", \"And so this is really feedback meant for you, you can do whatever you\\'d like with the information is just for you to consider.\", \"And so let\\'s go through each area.\", \"And there are a number of questions here and a number of sort of different anger dimensions.\", \"And I think the place we\\'re going to start is if you look at all the questions that you answered, it comes up with something called a total score, which is just kind of looking at everything together.\", \"And when we look at the total score, you scored quite high actually scored in a range that we would sort of call the 99th percentile, which means Yeah, which means that your anger is at Level greater than 99% of the population of men your ageNo, that\\'s kind of high.\", \"Kind of hard to hear it that way.\", \"Its kind of surprise you?It\\'s a little bit high.\", \"And it might indicate that that really anger does get you in trouble at times in terms of relationships and closing.\", \"So you\\'ve recognized thatOkay.\", \"So this kind of just highlights that and puts a number on and it soundsYeah, right.\", \"Exactly.\", \"Kind of comparing how you answered the question to, to the general population of folks of your age Because you\\'re really you\\'re sort of in the top 1% of scoresbecause getting angry saying things to people not thinking things through can really put you at riskSo Bethany, can you tell me what this week has looked like for you?\", \"So you\\'re feeling isolated from your family?So when you say you\\'re feeling disconnected Can you explain to me more what that looks like?So you feel that even though you made some progress by looking at them for jobs this week that you didn\\'t feel much accomplishment from that because your husband didn\\'t acknowledge it or appreciate it.How being not appreciated make you feel inside?I hear you saying that you\\'re shutting down.\", \"And not only do I hear you saying that, like I can see you sitting here with me.\", \"That way you\\'re sitting with your arms crossed, like I feel like you\\'re closing yourself off To a lot of things to a lot of people.ExactlySo I hear you saying that you\\'re experiencing a lot of hurt.\", \"So bad thing.\", \"You\\'re feeling all the skirt.\", \"You\\'re feeling in ways recognizing who you are.\", \"You have all this laundry.\", \"vacuums do its chores.\", \"So what to do is wave comedian.\", \"Put it away somewhere for a little bit to be able to address all the issues.\", \"You try to pay put in a little jar and we\\'ll call that trick jar.Okay.\", \"What do you think that that hurts trying to tell you?let\\'s take a minute and think about it.was the seller hurt, but maybe the hurt is important.\", \"We\\'ll be able to come back to it once we push it away.\", \"So it\\'s not going to be there forever.\", \"So if we do that,Let\\'s try doing this.\", \"He\\'s trying to close your eyes.\", \"If you\\'re doing breathing exercises here, take a deep breath in, Deep breath out, deep breath in, deep breath out imagine all the  laundry, Husband, daughter this, put it outside in the hallway, very quiet.\", \"How\\'s it feel?or is it in the hallway?What are you What are you feeling right now?but I don\\'t have an agenda today.\", \"So whatever, Whatever comes to mind already feels important.\", \"We\\'ll take a minute to think about it.\", \"Close your eyes and think about what you\\'re feeling.\", \"So what are you feeling right now?So, you feel guilty for not not worthy of feeling hurt not worthy So I want to, I want to kind of dive into that little bit, That\\'s arising between wanting to try something new.So, what I\\'m gonna do is I want you to think about this chair.\", \"I want you to picture yourself this is the side of you that says you deserve to be able to feel and that you don\\'t deserve to be focused on yourself.\", \"Tell yourself about how it makes you feel be guilty.First when I deserve it I deserve more than you want, You don\\'t deserve to Be, feel guilty about being you know deserve to feel guilty about being hurt.\", \"You need to take care of your thing.\", \"If I Don\\'t take care of them, They get upset?Does it make you feel yourself tells you that you\\'re sad.\", \"It makes me sad its hurts me.Why don\\'t you make me feel guilty?So when you tell yourself that I am hurt yourself selfish, how does that feel?So how does it make you feel the other self understandsSo really, it just feels more when you hear that you think it\\'s okay.\", \"I need to be validated.\", \"Tell yourself How can feel hurt without feeling guilty.So now you can come to an agreement with yourself to allow that space.So what do you do?\", \"Take this with you this week.Hi, how are you?Let\\'s see today and this evening.\", \"So, tell me a little bit more about why you\\'re here.Well, what is your objective?\", \"What do you want this today?maybe manage that a little bit better.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"Tell me is it schooling your game as at home your friends, so tell me aboutSo, before we get into this a little bit, I\\'m going to tell you a little bit about your brain.\", \"Okay?\", \"we ever heard of the amygdala?Yeah.\", \"When you get to high school, you\\'re gonna know about this in advance, but you\\'re gonna learn about this medical science.\", \"So your amygdala Like right here at the base of your brain back here And it\\'s known as the alarm center, saying think about pulling alarm, you know, an alarm is going off in your brain.\", \"And that alarm, normally it indicates fight or flight or freeze So makes you want to fight, fight back, right, It makes you want to freeze, just kind of pain free don\\'t let you do or flight which means get out of there, you know, get away.\", \"All right.\", \"So that\\'s kind of what your brain that\\'s the largest mess kind of your brain.\", \"So let\\'s think about some situations when you\\'re in these angry situations and let\\'s let\\'s let\\'s just kind of step through them.\", \"So give me an example.\", \"really specific of maybe two The alarm is going off and you are really angry.Okay, you\\'re a fighter.\", \"Alright.Mm hmm.Okay.okay, there\\'s just yesterday.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So situation mom asks you to do something.\", \"You\\'re kind of in the middle of something to get pestering you and yet you started yelling she started yelling starts escalating.\", \"you punch a wall.Okay.\", \"You got that situation Tell me about a situation at school.Hmm.Okay.\", \"So you\\'re in class teachers calling you out, and you\\'re angry and cursing.Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Good example.\", \"Is there any time when there\\'s anxiety that\\'s happening before the anger comes out?\", \"Like, um, maybe.\", \"Yeah, if you ever get anxious for us kind of freeze for years or more of a reactive of a fight of a last year.\", \"Have a get it out.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.Good.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, I want you to, um, it\\'s kind of helpful, I think, to understand a little bit about what\\'s going on in your brain.\", \"And then you can maybe help monitor it, help control it help manage it a little bit better.\", \"Okay.\", \"So let\\'s, um, I\\'d like to take you through an example of something it\\'s called, And it\\'s a way of it\\'s kind of it\\'s called wise mind, okay?\", \"You\\'re, you\\'re trying to be very conscientious about what\\'s going on around you.\", \"how you\\'re feeling, and how you\\'re going to react to risk being instead of just reacting whenever That\\'s off, you\\'re gonna think about it, name it, and then react.\", \"And hopefully, maybe we can get a little bit of more control on anger, reactions come in.okay.\", \"Well, you know what I was saying?\", \"Knowing that you need that, just saying, I need that.\", \"That\\'s a really big step.\", \"It really is.\", \"Some people don\\'t even acknowledge that they need it, don\\'t want to acknowledge it, don\\'t care to acknowledge it.\", \"And they\\'re not going to really get any not not going to change.\", \"But you\\'re here.\", \"Maybe you don\\'t want to be here, ut I\\'m hearing you say that you want to make a change.\", \"And that\\'s really huge.\", \"Because I think you want things to be different for yourself.\", \"It sounds like I mean,Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, there\\'s a desire that I see, And I appreciate that, And that\\'s great.\", \"And there are lots of different techniques for this.\", \"And I\\'m just going to offer one today.\", \"And then you can practice it all week, and then we talk next week, we\\'ll kind of see how you are with that and it\\'s not working for you, we\\'ll make modifications might change this, okay?\", \"Okay.\", \"And this is a technique where you can do it at school, at home, and only takes about one minute.\", \"Sometimes we don\\'t have a lot of time.\", \"You know, it\\'s great when you can take 15 minutes to calm down, maybe you\\'re going to bed at night and you\\'re doing something that makes you calm down and it\\'s quiet a lot of time.\", \"In the heat of the moment, we don\\'t have a lot of time.\", \"All right, when you feel that anger rising, there\\'s not a lot of time, alright?It happens a lot.\", \"Okay.\", \"This little procedure is called stop s t o p Alright, it\\'s a little acronym s t o p.\", \"So S T O P.\", \"So it means the first the S is to stop.\", \"So, for example, you\\'re watching TV, and your mom says, I was can you do this just please.\", \"Alright.\", \"right then and there, you\\'re gonna say, Okay, stop.\", \"And then you\\'re gonna take a breath.\", \"Okay, you\\'re gonna breathe in, deeply, you\\'re gonna be down.\", \"Just like take two deep breaths and think about your breathing.\", \"Breathe in and breathe out.\", \"Okay?\", \"So the T is for take a breath.\", \"All right, take a breath.\", \"All right.\", \"And when you\\'re taking a breath, think about you know, your, your brain releases a lot of oxygen.\", \"So when you\\'re breathing in, you\\'re breathing oxygen into your lungs, gets into your blood gets to your brain.\", \"You\\'re getting a lot of oxygen, your brain which really helps you think better.\", \"Alright, Breathing in and lot of oxygen right there.\", \"All right, the O means observe what is going on around you right now.\", \"All right.\", \"so in this situation, your mom asked you to do the dishes.\", \"You\\'re watching the program.\", \"All right.\", \"Like to finish the program, I think I heard you say, and then you\\'re going to do the dishes.\", \"That\\'s how you would like it might not be how mom like it.\", \"But you might be able to, if you can kind of get observe the situation and how you\\'re feeling.\", \"A little man, mom just asked me to do this.\", \"And she\\'s seen him like watching the show here.\", \"Alright, so you\\'re observing how you\\'re feeling?\", \"All right, watching the show.\", \"I\\'m getting frustrated that she\\'s asked me to do this right now, observe it, name it, claim it and say, okay, that\\'s how I\\'m feeling right now.\", \"All right.\", \"So you\\'re just aware you\\'re observing the situation and how you\\'re feeling okay.\", \"And then so the O is for observe and the P is for proceed, that means move forward.\", \"But something that\\'s going to benefit you that\\'s going to be positive that\\'s going to work for you.\", \"You\\'re not your mom is not working for you?get you in trouble.\", \"Get your hand in the wall, you might get hurt.\", \"Moving forward Yon and your mom\\'s not working for you too.\", \"Well, is it?\", \"Okay?\", \"So we\\'re going to proceed with something that\\'s going to work for you.\", \"In this situation, you have an idea that might work for you.a good idea though, it\\'s a good thought it might be worth a try to say, and maybe it\\'s more, instead of telling her to do it later saying, Mom, okay, 10 more minutes with this show.\", \"There\\'s two more minutes.\", \"I\\'m really interested in this show.\", \"And I just finished the 10 more minutes, and then I will do the dishes, kind of put it in a question.\", \"So, you know, instead of you know, say, I\\'m gonna do it later say, I just got 10 more minutes and I really want to finish the show.\", \"Is it okay if I just do the dishes as soon as in 10 minutes when I finish the show?\", \"Does that sound like something that maybeYeah, yeah, I hear that.Well, I\\'m glad you acknowledge that.\", \"That\\'s really good.\", \"So let\\'s step through that one more time.\", \"s t o p.\", \"s is for?Yeah.\", \"All right, stop.\", \"Before you react Before you respond in anger You\\'re gonna stop.\", \"What\\'s the T?Exactly, Take a breath in action into your brain.\", \"So you can think clearly, rationally, Take two big breaths.\", \"Three, maybe.\", \"O?observe what\\'s going on?\", \"What\\'s going on my body?\", \"My my thoughts was this situation You know?\", \"How am I feeling right now?Name it, Claim it, Okay.\", \"This won\\'t finish All right, and then what\\'s the P?proceed, That\\'s right.\", \"Proceed.\", \"How am I gonna go forward in a way that\\'s gonna be helpful to me or good for me or benefit me?\", \"Right?\", \"So what?\", \"What in that situation was the P going to be?\", \"Was the proceed going to be how you\\'re going to proceed?Yeah, yeah, in a calm voice ask her soon as this program is over, can I do it?\", \"Man, I really want to finish this then I promise you I\\'ll do the dishes as soon as this program is over.Yeah, there you go.\", \"Again, in that situation.\", \"Very good.\", \"You\\'re getting what you want.\", \"She\\'s gonna get what she wants.\", \"It\\'s a great compromise.\", \"Yeah.\", \"worth a shot.\", \"worth a try?Okay.\", \"Yeah, you know, it takes a lot of time to make a change, really does.\", \"You\\'ve been doing it one way for a long time.\", \"And it takes a lot of time to do something different.\", \"So I want you to be patient with yourself.\", \"I want you to try this every day.\", \"All right, if you can kind of make notes.\", \"For me, as we can talk about next week, like on Monday, I had a fight with my mom, I tried it, it didn\\'t work.\", \"On Tuesday, I find my mom, it works a little bit, you know?\", \"And when you The more you do this, the better you\\'re going to get.\", \"And the more it\\'s going to benefit you.\", \"All right, the more it\\'s gonna benefit you.you\\'re right, You\\'re right, Because they\\'re a certain way in the house.\", \"And it\\'s going to be Yeah, be patient with yourself and realize this is going to take some time.\", \"Okay.\", \"Let\\'s think about at school, a situation if you want to take that one situation at school too.\", \"Okay, say you\\'re in history class, history, human history don\\'t get during your history class and she\\'s calling on you, Right?\", \"This is when you get angry.\", \"Is that not correct about that?\", \"Now she asking you So is she saying okay Alyssa can you answer this question, is that what she\\'s calling or she\\'s saying Alyssa wake up because you\\'re asleep.\", \"What is your truth?okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So let\\'s kind of step through this stop process with that.\", \"Alright, teachers gonna ask you what somehow to tell us about that.\", \"All right?\", \"Instead of what\\'s the normal reaction for you, your alarm going off, what\\'s the normal reaction for you?Okay, all right.\", \"You\\'re gonna try to stop.\", \"All right.\", \"You\\'re gonna take a breath, two breaths.\", \"You\\'re gonna say, Alright, how you feel at that point?\", \"She\\'s embarrassing me.\", \"What else is going on?\", \"She knows I know, She\\'s just trying to test me.\", \"She knows I don\\'t know the answer because honestly, you should call.\", \"Okay?Right?\", \"kind of tired of it.\", \"So you\\'re naming that, alright, frustrated, you know, she doesn\\'t answer by me.\", \"Okay?\", \"You\\'re, you\\'re observing what\\'s going on in the situation, But how are you going to proceed in a positive way?\", \"All right, instead of y\\'all And getting sent out of the room?\", \"Can you think of a way that might benefit you more?\", \"That might be to your advantage.\", \"Getting out of the room and going down the hall is not helping you too much.\", \"So what\\'s a way you can proceed?\", \"you\\'re frustrated.\", \"You are maybe a little bit embarrassed, maybe don\\'t know the answer.\", \"What\\'s what can you do instead of yell at that teacher and get angry at her with the other thought maybe?Okay.\", \"Well, that\\'s, that\\'s the truth.\", \"You might know or may not know if that\\'s true.\", \"You can say just simply that I don\\'t know then she\\'s gonna go to somebody else, right?that\\'d be the hope that she goes to somebody else.\", \"But for you, you won\\'t be sent out of the room.\", \"You won\\'t be getting in Trouble, you won\\'t be in ISS for the dayone objective is not for you in school is for you to get to the next grade.\", \"Get the next grade in that classroom, learn a little bit so you can get to the next grade.\", \"yeah, that\\'s good.\", \"You got a desire to do that.\", \"So, this procedure is kind of only takes 45 seconds or so, for you to stop.\", \"Take a few breaths, observe what\\'s going on, kind of name your emotions, okay, and this and this and this, however, don\\'t want to respond with angry words or yelling or cursing because it\\'s not going to benefit me, you know, trying to make a change here.\", \"I\\'m going to figure out what is my best tool to proceed that\\'s going to help me you know, work out arrange with mom or just tell her that you don\\'t know, okay?And again, be patient with yourself because this type change takes a while.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"Are you willing to maybe practice this once a day, every day, it can either be at home or it can be in the classroom this next week?Okay.\", \"Just try it and see how it works.\", \"And if this I have a lot of tricks up my sleeve, so if this one isn\\'t working, we can modify or we can try something else but try to set it in and we\\'ll just kind of talk about it next week and just kind of see how it\\'s going.\", \"Okay.\", \"Thanks for coming in.Appreciate you want to make change and willing to do somethingHi, Jessica, how are you doing?\", \"I am doing Okay.\", \"So, um, how have you been doing today?\", \"How\\'s your week been?\", \"Um, so in our last session together, we talked about your lack of confidence.\", \"Do you feel like you might be progress on that?Good, good.So, when you say you\\'ve been journaling, were you able to when you had a negative thought, or you know, sometimes situation, negative thought, were you writing down a negative thought?and you were able to make it a positive thought.So do you remember kind of what what we discussed last time about how CBT works?So would you comment review before we actually get into the session?Okay.\", \"So how it goes is like a cya situation or an event happens.\", \"You have a thought, Okay.\", \"And what kind of last time it was your lack of confidence?\", \"And it could be like, I\\'m not good enough.\", \"But that was your your thought process last time, correct?\", \"And then so when you have a thought you have an emotion.\", \"Last time you were saying how it made you feel bad about yourself, you felt incompetent.\", \"And then your behavior issue where you lash out at others and remain.\", \"So do you feel like that you kind of understand that?\", \"So I know last time I said, we talked about your lack of confidence.\", \"So for example, I know you mentioned that you also were having problems with using marijuana and depression.\", \"You had problems with depression.\", \"And you also had anger issues.\", \"And out of those, which one do you think you ought to put up to discuss today?\", \"Okay.\", \"Coming over about driver issues.can you telll me about the last time you lost your anger?yeah, things are kind of expensive.Okay, so now what I\\'m writing down here is kind of like what we talked about how there\\'s no family situation, you know thought and you have an emotion.\", \"So I know like what you were just saying the event or the situation was that you got your hair done and that he was angry about that.okay okay.\", \"Now what did you in that moment when he was being mean what was now how youfelt but what was your actual thought when he was saying all that stuff?Okay So when he when when he was getting mad at you and then telling you you\\'re selfish and you felt substrate got yourself I\\'m selfish and then you got angry.\", \"What did you do after you get angry?Okay, okay.There was physical contact there.So when he when he has these, he kind of gets upset at you for certain things like this.\", \"How do you think you could change from the smacking him to having a more calm and positive response?how do you think you might be able to do that?Like, this is how we would do it with CBT we would change your thought.\", \"So what He gets upset with you and calls you selfish.\", \"You start to feel selfish.So how could you not feel selfish?\", \"Even if you changed your thought?So do you think you\\'re selfish?So I\\'m hearing you say is you don\\'t think you\\'re selfish at all.so instead of thinking I\\'m selfish, what could you actually think?I deserve this?I mean, who doesn\\'t deserve something every now and then.\", \"Right?\", \"Okay, so if you were thinking I deserved that.\", \"That was your thought when he was getting angry.\", \"He thought no, I\\'m sorry.\", \"This How do you think that would actually Make you feel what kind of emotion would you feel at that point?\", \"I drives you so confident?So if you felt competent about your decision, because you actually changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually get an angry you would think there\\'s no need for this?Right.\", \"So how do you think you\\'d actually behave them?Right.\", \"So maybe I\\'m so thinking also that you\\'re selfish when he\\'s getting my back.\", \"Could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me, he just doesn\\'t understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this.\", \"And explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself.\", \"Because, you know, you know, you\\'re not selfish.\", \"It\\'s just something that makes you feel good.\", \"So do you think in like in the next coming week that you could actually change your thoughtsin targeted change how you feel?Yeah, okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay, since we talked about your angry sheets, I know you were saying last time that you were also having problems with depression and you\\'re also having marijuana use and either one of those would you want to discuss?\", \"Or I mean, would you like to discuss your you know, your anger issues furtherOkay.\", \"What do you think triggers your depression, what makes you depressed?How old is your son?Okay.\", \"So the interesting ageOkay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So the situation here is that your son doesn\\'t want to be involved with you as much.Okay And have you know, what do you think to yourself when he doesn\\'t want to talk to mom anymore?\", \"He doesn\\'t want to be mom.\", \"He\\'s out doing his own thing.So when you What is your exact thought though when when this stuff happens?Yeah, that\\'s hard.\", \"When you when you\\'ve always been needed before?I fee like what kind of motion you are feeling?In turn, what did you What did you do in that situation?\", \"Okay.\", \"Do you think you use the marijuana also because you\\'re pressed?Okay.\", \"So and what are you saying for me if I\\'m wrong is that, you know, your son doesn\\'t want to be involved anymore.\", \"You don\\'t feel like you\\'re needed.\", \"That\\'s what you say to yourself and that makes you feel sad and lonely.\", \"And then in turn you use marijuana.So, you don\\'t want to do you want to use marijuana?Okay, that\\'s okay.\", \"So what what I kind of want you to do for the for the next session is kind of what we were continuing what we were doing last week, you know, how you journaled and when you have a negative thought that you changed it to a positive thought.\", \"And then in turn, you solve it like, how it could change your behavior.So do you think you could do that again?Like when Tom such as when your son, you know, it\\'s kind of goes along around you think instead of I\\'m not eating and stuff like am I eating more thinking, you know, he\\'s growing up that\\'s good appraised of you know, a son that is active and, and who is enjoying life?\", \"And then how does that make you feel if you actually thought to yourself?\", \"you know, because he\\'s probably in a good place and active and social one good person because of you.\", \"So that would make you happy I would think.\", \"And then no.\", \"Maybe then you could, you know, have a different behavior do something different.\", \"Okay.\", \"So journaling.\", \"Does that sound good?I am glad you I came in today.\", \"How\\'s it going today for you?Well, from last week when you talked to me kind of talked about your situation, getting injured on the job, and if you\\'re losing your job, you kind of get to where you didn\\'t want to do anything and sleeping a lot.\", \"Its Very hard on you And so I had to take that inventory and turn all those questions, kind of scored that and in fact do pretty severe depression.\", \"So I thought we might do today, if it\\'s okay with you is there\\'s a therapy I\\'d like to try with you to kind of address your depression.\", \"It\\'s called cognitive behavioral therapy.\", \"If you\\'ve ever heard that, Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"I\\'ll describe it a little bit to you, see if we can kind of work on that therapy to kind of help your depression and I\\'m thinking this might impact a lot of areas in your life.\", \"Getting to work and relationships and stuff and you kind of focus on the depression right now.\", \"And then I\\'d like to drift off talked about that in some situations where you\\'re feeling depressed, if we can want to give you some tools maybe to take home this week, to kind of Talk about the situation\\'s of your depression and thoughts and feelings and stuff.\", \"And then and then so next week, we can have some concrete.\", \"So think about that.\", \"Some of you that we do that todayRight?\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s a big part of it.\", \"Your willingness to try This is a big key part in cognitive behavioral therapy because you\\'re willing to, to do work to get better.\", \"Let me tell you a little bit about the cognitive behavioral therapy sometimes called CBT, just initials, and it takes an individual situation that\\'s happening with individual, a thought that automatically comes into the mind of an individual, how it makes them feel, and then how they respond because of that feeling.\", \"Okay, so we\\'ll take an example why Tell me about the last time that you were feeling depressed.okay.\", \"What was going on this morning?Alright you Woke up and couldn\\'t get out of bed.\", \"What\\'s the first thought that came into your mind?How do you you feel about yourself?because of that feeling, what would you do?\", \"Were you able to get out of bed or just stayed in bed?\", \"Let me congratulate you for getting out of bed and coming here today that\\'s a big step.You often have those feelings when you\\'re depressed of worthless?typically Is your response to that feeling stay in bed or?Let me ask you, Tommy Can you remember a time when you weren\\'t depressed?tell me a little bit about those times when you can remember before the accident when you weren\\'t experienced Some depressing.Knew how you felt back then?\", \"How did you feel when those activities were going on?It kind of feel like the opposite of worthless.\", \"I mean, they needed you and you felt good and you felt loved and engaged in their life.So sometime when you have these worthless feelings of not being able to get out of bed, do you think it would help you to think about times when you felt pretty good about yourself?\", \"So maybe when you feeling down, can\\'t get off the couch.\", \"Can\\'t get out of bed.\", \"I think of some times when it was different for you, you were in a different situation.\", \"But you certainly didn\\'t feel this way.\", \"And you didn\\'t feel loved engaged Important party.What about when you were working?\", \"How do you feel about yourself at work?I am glad you can still feel or remember some times when you felt that you did  have a purpose, and you felt loved and valued.\", \"And I know with depression, it\\'s hard to get up and get out of bed.\", \"That\\'s some of the.\", \"A lot of people will say, you know, if I\\'m going to wait till I feel better, and then I\\'m going to get up and I\\'m going to get out of bed and then I\\'m going to do a lot of time with depression, which you actually have to do.\", \"You have to get up out of bed and do something, and then you feel better.\", \"I know it\\'s kind of hard to do that with these feelings that you\\'re feeling right now.\", \"and sometimes it\\'s helpful to have something scheduled or planned right now in your in your life tell me some things that you might enjoy doing.\", \"Might could think about be worth getting out of bed in order to do?When was the Last time you went fishing?Are you recovered enough from accident in which you could go fishing sad it that reality, something that you could do?Okay, great.\", \"So fishing is something that that with Are there any other activities or meeting with people?\", \"Nice remind me Is your wife out of town and the kids so it\\'s a little bit more difficult to maybe see them on a regular basis.\", \"Okay, other activities besides fishing that might enjoy doing or being with people or things you enjoy doing?\", \"When you pleasure?That\\'s something that might be able to be planned or you might be able to have a get together with at least one if it\\'s not the whole group, you know, one or two old buddies.OkayThat\\'s another good suggestion.\", \"As far as what do you Is there an activity you should do even by yourself either playing an instrument or listen to music or exercising or watching movies or something that gives you pleasure that you don\\'t necessarily need.\", \"I mean, fishing is a good way you don\\'t really need anybody else for but just thinking in case your bodies were busy, I\\'m thinking of another thing you might want to do that brings you pleasure.and how  that make you feel?And those are some good suggestions of things that you might want.\", \"It\\'s your product To start out slow and scheduling some things, it\\'s nice to have, if you can, something on your agenda every day in order for you to get a bit for it might be a workout, it might be going fishing.\", \"It might be calling a buddy to schedule something or might be hanging out with the friend.\", \"Okay.\", \"So, Tom, I\\'d like your goal this next week and you can you can write it on this piece of paper right here kind of kind of journal about it you know, put the date and go ahead and put I\\'d like you to have some.\", \"When you can first talk about maybe when you\\'re in bed and can\\'t get out.\", \"You can write about your thought the automatic thoughts coming into your mind you know, in bed.\", \"My automatic thought is ?Okay, No reason to get out of bed.\", \"Man very Use the word worthless, whatever that automatic thought that comes in your mind, write that down, and then write down how that makes you feel.\", \"And then you mentioned often your action or your that response to that feeling is just to stay in bed.\", \"All right.\", \"So I\\'d like for you to go ahead and log those emotions when those situations occur, you know that the situation, the thought, the emotion and your reaction to it, good.\", \"Another thing I\\'d like you to do is, if you can schedule one event today, alright, that you would enjoy doing.\", \"And it couldn\\'t be a phone call doesn\\'t have to be getting that and give yourself a break, know that this is going to be difficult.\", \"And you\\'re going to start out slow, and you\\'re going to work up to it, but just one event a day.\", \"Now, I want you to log in as well.\", \"You know, whether it is I called my kids, or I called my buddy to schedule something or I went to work out all right.\", \"And also we\\'d like you to write down how you felt about yourself.\", \"After you did that after the phone call, how you felt about yourself after the workout, how it makes you feel, all right after you got together with your buddies, alright, so go ahead and document this progression, and then log, the different activities that\\'s here, and then we\\'ll talk about it next week.\", \"We can talk about what\\'s you know, these automatic thoughts, and then any of these activities and if any of these activities are actually helpingyou might take a while time you have to be patient with the process.\", \"Be patient with yourself and, and other other people.\", \"I mean, you mentioned a while ago that your buddies you know, they they tried connecting with you and it was difficult to party.\", \"Glad that you\\'re wanting to be engaged as well.\", \"Something That  you Can do this week?feel overwhelming Or?I think that\\'s a big part of this, the willingness to try.\", \"The patience, process will take time one step at a time we can talk about and see what\\'s working, and what\\'s not working, and we can make changes on it.\", \"But it I think this CBT really helps you think about, you know, what\\'s going on and why am I feeling this way, you know, identifying the thoughts in your mind and While I might be thinking of this, and while I\\'m reacting because of this, and you might even write your emotion and say, yesterday, I felt, you know, my feeling of worthlessness on a scale from one to 100 was 90.\", \"But today, it\\'s actually 80.\", \"And maybe next week, it might be 70.\", \"So you want to add a particular number to associate your, your association with that feeling of worthlessness if you want to kind of put a value on it, you know, and we can kind of see how that adjusts with time.\", \"might be helpful.We will talk about that next timeOh Hello there is there Ms Dorsey?How can I help you today?Okay.\", \"It really helped me if I could ask a few more questions about how you feeling?\", \"Yeah, maybe symptoms and then we can sort of see how it can help you with that\\'d be okay.So why don\\'t you tell me a bit more about what\\'s brought you here today?Okay, why don\\'t we just look at one of those things at a time.\", \"Tell me a bit more about you say having trouble sleeping.Okay, and you have problems with your apetite.And what\\'s about sort of life in general you kind of lost you get up and go?you get up and go you your energy levels are low.Can you just came back to sleep?\", \"Can you tell me a bit more about that?\", \"How much sleep Are you getting each night?Sounds like your lack of energy and lack of sleep and lack of appetite.\", \"Seems to me that thing that seemed to really get you down.You say you\\'re a mess.Okay.\", \"It would be helpful for me just to sort of find out a bit more about home life or work life and ask a few questions in that area.\", \"Would that be okay?So do you work?I\\'ve got some patients who work in the same environments very high pressuresand who else is at home with you?Do they get to their their father much?must be quite hard on both you and them.Does she live locally?What about you?\", \"What about your hobbies and things you enjoy?Well I know you\\'ve you\\'re not a doctor but you must have had thoughts about what\\'s causing all these feelings that you thought about about these these type of thingswhat tends to bother you the most Is it the sleep or the your appetite or the energy or sleep coping with the kids asleep.that was gonna be really well I\\'m going to ask next.\", \"I mean, what are your thoughts about how he could help you today?\", \"Would it be a good idea perhaps if we think about all the options available to you and then decide which which ones may be best for youwe might have heard of some of the talking therapies, being able to sit down and talk with us, sort of a trained counselor about about your feelings and about what\\'s been happening.It may help you deal with some of your feelings.\", \"I take on board about the thoughts about using a sleeping tablet.\", \"I think that could be another option.\", \"Obviously, when the concerns we have is that we don\\'t want to have you on sleeping tablets for a long period of time because their issues about becoming dependent on them and reliant on them.\", \"We can use them for a short period of time, say, for a week to help you get back into a bit more of a normal sleep.\", \"What\\'s about those the two options as option the counselor, or perhaps sleeping pills?Okay, so you\\'d like to try both.\", \"I think that that sounds a good idea.\", \"Would you be happy to the counselor here at surgery?\", \"Okay, so I can organize that I can speak to her and ask her to contact you to make an appointment.\", \"It also be really helpful for me as well, if you could complete one of our heads questionnaires.Sorry.\", \"It\\'s a short questionnaire just asking some questions about your feelings and it\\'ll help me to find out.\", \"If there\\'s any more help, I can give you an annex, see if that\\'s okay.\", \"From what you\\'ve told me today, I mean, it sounds really for the last 12 months or so you\\'ve felt really low.\", \"Since split from you, your husband.Your sleeps not being good.\", \"your appetite is not being good.is sounds to me.\", \"Self esteems taking a real not because I certainly think the help we can give you with some counts in which we have a counselor that comes here in the surgery that will be it\\'ll be a benefit to you.\", \"And then we\\'ll try the short course of sleep tablets to try and get you back into a state sleep pattern.maybe I can see you in about two, three weeks time.\", \"And I don\\'t want you to think that you have to sort of manage all this by yourself.\", \"I mean, that\\'s why we\\'re here.\", \"We\\'re here to, to help and support you.\", \"Let me do the prescription then.So that\\'s gone to reception as you can catch up on the way out.And I\\'ll give you one of the heads question as well.Complete that before we see you next time.Okay, see  you next time.\", \"Okay, bye bye.Welcome, Kayla.\", \"Thanks for coming today.Okay, they app counselors provide services to clients all over LA.\", \"And they provide the city offices with offices in the western suburbs.\", \"But we also allow our counselors to go to the residents of our clients and my boss is no boss.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And that that\\'s working out to be beneficial because a lot of clients don\\'t feel comfortable coming to places where they can be still saying.Yeah, I feel that there\\'s an amazing amount of information that comes from the AAPC diploma.\", \"We constantly use many of the articles and the actual forms that were used in the studies throughout the diploma, for instance, the personality profile that really helps our clients To understand what the personalities are and how that can be within a relationship, we also use the five types of conflict, don\\'t see in the readings that allows us to explain to clients that there\\'s different types of conflicts and how they can upset a relationship.\", \"So we use a fair amount of the information that came out is that one that really helps benefit our clients.\", \"It\\'s a benefit because they\\'re there.\", \"They\\'re all unique in their sorry, they\\'re all uniform.\", \"When it comes to what Adelaide counseling practice needs, we like to know that we have uniformity in our counselors.\", \"And we know that the AAPC can offer that because we\\'ve all learned the same base units and then when it comes to the actual majors, that Some of the staff that we have taken on, they can also add to the fall of the year for the service ofAbsolutely.Without a doubt, yeah, there we haven\\'t had any issues with the people that we\\'ve taken on board.\", \"They\\'ve all been professional and well educated and fantastic with our clients.I truly believe that this course amongst others that I\\'ve resource before I didn\\'t give the actual diploma has to be the most in depth to have actually seen, even to the point where I\\'m now doing a psychology degree and I don\\'t believe that with the psychology degree would have the confidence to counsel clients because it doesn\\'t actually show you how to practice, whereas the diploma shows you exactly how to practice.\", \"Absolutely.\", \"Thank you.Thank you, Carol.Alright, Hi Sandra.\", \"Well, we have about half an hour together to sign and how are you feeling right now?\", \"What\\'s your awareness?\", \"There\\'s a bit of a kind of the situation is different from last time.What is it the frustation like for you?So let\\'s shift it to body where in your body you feel this type feeling?So that\\'s a hot area, feeling around the heart.\", \"And what is there in that heart and you pay attention to that, that area in your heart?\", \"What What do you find?\", \"What sort of thing?I noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feelings.\", \"And I would like to suggest if you can say instead of being it, and see what happens in your body so go aheadSo that\\'s what\\'s coming up frustration, anger.\", \"So what are you doing this moment with your anger as you said to me right here to chest this moment?once you accept that anger inside you, what else do you do with that anger having accepted?Use the word Hi.\", \"It\\'s a thing that to acknowledge this is, you know, something out there, we do a lot Something very strong.\", \"So it\\'s a safe way to put it.\", \"But if you say I feel angry,But who do you feel angry at?You ex husband?Sandra, having just explore some of your feelings around the situation you have, I\\'m going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair.\", \"This may be a little uncomfortable.\", \"But it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer, and you\\'ll be in dialoguing with a party that you are actually having to deal with.\", \"And I\\'ll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change process okay.\", \"It\\'s been Jeff and your imagination that the massive Jeff we\\'re here.\", \"I\\'ll bring a chair.\", \"Okay.\", \"Welcome, Jeff.\", \"I mean I welcome Jeff.\", \"And, and there\\'s Jeff.\", \"Imagine his face looks like how you remember him and bring him in and your fantasy.\", \"And then when you\\'re ready to just say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneous.Okay.\", \"Okay, so there\\'s a kind of question you understand why this happened, etc.\", \"Right?\", \"So what next thing we\\'ll do, you\\'ll sit over there, and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at.\", \"That maybe a little bit difficult But let\\'s do a dialogue as if he were he\\'s not here anyway.\", \"So we\\'ll, we\\'ll be having a dialogue between Jeff, imaginary Jeff, and you in the present here and now.\", \"Okay.\", \"And what is what is he saying?\", \"I know they\\'re the hurts and frustration a but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father.Actually what kind of father you should be for the children?Sounds like a very good idea.\", \"Good offer you Jeff, are you prepared to take that off for the kids sake?\", \"Its great go your way what\\'s what\\'s going on here?\", \"The contracts happening okay.\", \"Seems Parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important.\", \"That\\'s the children.\", \"So children will not suffer, they will actually benefit from that agreement, if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how we\\'re going to take care of the children.\", \"Because the thing no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple separate together, the contract life countries, I\\'m still my father to my children as a mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out, we can come to an agreement as to how we\\'re going to work together and even if you don\\'t, they don\\'t live together.\", \"We would live for the with the kids they\\'d be happy.\", \"Does that make sense to you?But you hear that this happened for you.\", \"And you\\'ve done it.\", \"So is there something that the now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter how he is?\", \"Because there\\'s now a new realization that the children need that.\", \"Father and Mother.\", \"How\\'s that for you?\", \"you\\'re good at that.\", \"You\\'re very good.\", \"Who\\'s watching you working here?\", \"You\\'re very good at creating contracts and very clear about what you want.\", \"And it\\'s a question of how you can the two parties can get to that agreement together.\", \"What do you think?Great, because that\\'s, this is a rehearsal for what\\'s going to happen.Well, that\\'s the housekeeping finish with Kathleen.\", \"So perhaps you\\'d like to tell me a bit about what brings you here today?So you\\'re supposed to finish at 330 Why do you think you\\'re not finishing it through 330?right, So that\\'s really the problem that we\\'ll get You work and there\\'s no way you can fit into the the times that you were employed to work.\", \"I can see that I can see you\\'re getting quite stressed about it.\", \"So have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this?\", \"Kathleen?\", \"Is there anything you think you could do?so you really do feel that you need to talk to the boss that includes you and explain what the problem is.\", \"Is this something you feel comfortable about doing?Okay, because she was lovely there.\", \"She says, Do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her, that she\\'d actually be quite receptive to listening to you?okay.\", \"What I\\'m going to suggest Kathleen is that we do something called a role play.\", \"And what that is, is that we act out the situation, whatever it is.\", \"And in your case, it\\'s going to be you going and talking to your boss and trying to explain to her that you\\'ve got a problem trying to fit your work into the house, which is supposed to be working.\", \"So you\\'ll be playing, you end up playing your boss.\", \"Now, obviously, you\\'re not going to get exactly the same responses from your boss that you\\'ll get from me today.\", \"But it does give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it, to practice it, and to get a response that you can then react to and practice your way through a possible scenario.\", \"And what this could do happily Give you a bit more confidence about the swing.\", \"Well, we practice it right now.\", \"Oh, I can, what we\\'ll do is, you\\'ll be you.\", \"And I\\'ll be the doctor that you\\'re going to see.\", \"Let\\'s just think about a couple of things to get it started.well, what do you think would be the best time of day to do it?\", \"Oh, topic daySounds like a good idea because then you don\\'t have to worry.Okay, so have you had any got any thoughts about what you might say?\", \"How are you going to introduce?That\\'s fantastic.because that gives her the chance the opportunity to say well, No, it isn\\'t.\", \"Could you come in five minutes.\", \"I\\'m sorry.\", \"Oh, Go straight into it.\", \"That\\'s really good.\", \"Okay.\", \"Should we give it a try?\", \"So I\\'m gonna get you to stand up and pretend that you knocking on the doors that what you do.\", \"Yes, yes.\", \"All right.\", \"So I want you to get out and just do that and then come back in as if you\\'re having to see your boss and the boss to tell me what to yeahYeah, sure.\", \"Good, thank you.obviously you\\'re employed 830 to 330  Kathlleine hours we want you to work so we don\\'t want you working back so first of all, this is important that you know that we want you to leave at 330 and that\\'s what I want you to do.\", \"But from what you\\'re saying the work you\\'re being given doesn\\'t fit into those hourswhat\\'s happening here I\\'m getting too much work from the other doctorsI think I\\'ve got the picture.I\\'m glad you came to me.\", \"I really need this job.\", \"Look.\", \"I\\'m really glad you came to see But obviously 830 to 330 is not enough.\", \"It\\'s a long day, early as you\\'re supposed to work.\", \"So I need to have a look into this and see what\\'s going on.\", \"Kathleen.\", \"Yes, I\\'ll have a look at it.\", \"But I want you to make sure that you do leave at 330 every day.Obviously the responses that I gave are not going to be the ones you\\'ll get from doctor because she is sure this is what she said she.\", \"So there\\'ll be something similar, but the important thing is, I think, to work out that first opening gambit, isn\\'t it and it\\'s true and to do that, and then flow on so That\\'s something I want you to think about.\", \"Perhaps a few.\", \"You guys come and see me next week and about a week perhaps.Well, let\\'s look at it.\", \"What I\\'d like you to do is think about what we\\'ve done today.\", \"Yes, but but don\\'t don\\'t.\", \"Don\\'t overdo it don\\'t sort of keep it down for your mind.\", \"Well, exactly.\", \"That\\'s what I was going to say.\", \"I can see that you\\'re getting a bit, too.I know.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So having the right words is a help.\", \"That will help you to get a bit of confidence there.\", \"But importantly, I think we need to relax a bit, don\\'t we?\", \"And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you that I\\'d like you to go away and practice.\", \"So that horrified by next week when you come, you\\'ll practice those relaxation exercises, because they have things that you can use anyway in any situation.\", \"I\\'ll tell you what I know you don\\'t have to lie on the floor.\", \"Not for these because that\\'s not very practical before you go see your boss.\", \"So, what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week\\'s time and your practice the relaxation exercises, we\\'ll go through them again, and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real.\", \"What do you think?\", \"How are you?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thank you for asking.\", \"I understand that.\", \"You\\'ve come here today because you\\'ve had some symptoms that have been bothering you.You\\'ve lost three jobs in the past year.\", \"Is it because of things?Alright, so you have a system you go through of unplugging.\", \"Yeah, different objects in your apartment.\", \"And you\\'re worried that they\\'re going to cause a problem if they\\'re left plugged in.You\\'re so afraid that if you leave them plugged in or overheat, and your apartment will catch on fire.And you have a particular order, you go in as you unplug,What happens if you\\'re unplugging the items and you get distracted or something interrupts thatWill you plug the objects back in?\", \"Are we how we do it for the items are already unplugged?I should go back and plug them in?What\\'s your anxiety level?\", \"Like as you start that process?Is it?How about towards the end of the process?Okay, so So when it comes back, everything\\'s unplugged.\", \"So you have to plug everything back in, unplug it.\", \"And go through the whole process again.\", \"It\\'s just pretty distressing.Yeah.\", \"And you think that This is what led to the problems of deployment.Sure your employer wasn\\'t wasn\\'t happy with that.And that led to those new job.you\\'re working now?wasn\\'t a good fit.\", \"So this so these symptoms have caused you some real problems.With employment and how about with your anxiety level?If we were to put on a scale like one was very little exciting.\", \"A 10 was the worst anxiety you\\'ve ever experienced.\", \"What kind of anxiety having a daily basis now?by 10.\", \"So the worst everand checking the door was checking light switches, unplugging everything.\", \"This reduces your anxiety for a while just forBut then it comes back?Is there anything else that you do that helps to reduce the anxiety?Do you know how long you\\'ve had these symptoms?So So sometime Yeah.\", \"Did they start off?\", \"Like they are now?\", \"Or are they different?It was the same thing that help reduce anxiety.didn\\'t cause any trouble?Will you ever taken somewhere and diagnosed or treated?And now it\\'s now it\\'s the worst it\\'s ever been.Do you feel like you\\'re able to go back to work with the symptoms?\", \"Boy they are now?Because they\\'re so disruptive.Have you ever had any medical conditions?And have you ever used or do use a types of a type of drug or alcohol.And I want to thank you for coming.\", \"I\\'m going to get you scheduled to see one of our counselors.\", \"I appreciate you spending time with me.\", \"It\\'s helped me to understand what you\\'re going through.Thanks.Can I have you go back to this statement that you made?\", \"I just really feel alone No matter what I do Could You say that again for me a little slower.I\\'m going to ask I\\'m just going to interrupt you gently again.\", \"Okay, and see if we can get you back to this moment.\", \"Where this loneliness is showing up.\", \"Could you just for me one time say I\\'m really feeling this loneliness.Okay and just stay there.\", \"Just be aware of what your body\\'s doing.\", \"Notice your hands.\", \"Notice the little shimmer as you breathe in.\", \"Notice the feel of the tears in your eyes and rolling down your cheeks.\", \"And let\\'s just stay in this moment with this experience.Yeah, now notice Got your mind said that in this moment and you just took a deep breath.\", \"Stay with it for just another few moments.\", \"I\\'m going to slow you down again.\", \"And just with the jet from a very gentle place, very gentle place ask you to stay and Notice that\\'s all.\", \"Your breath As you observe yourself, can you feel it changing?\", \"You feel it move in and out.\", \"So what you notice here is that as a process, like you\\'re experiencing an ongoing sense in each moment of sadness, your hands moving, tears rolling down your cheek.\", \"So one thing that your experience tells you is that you can stand it and it keeps changing.\", \"Well, so let\\'s start there with no one noticing that you\\'ve walked into a room?\", \"what emotion comes up with?Are you feeling it now?So just stay with what you\\'re feeling right now, even the little bit be present to that.What other areas are you on the outside?For how long this has been a problem for you?So you could probably describe this all kinds of things about how this happens.Right  Right.so outskirts is really part of the problem being on the outskirts?Hi, dogRight.Okay.\", \"And so what happened from there then just tell me a little bit about what\\'s happened so that I\\'m up to speed.Okay.\", \"So in between the scan happening and the second scan happening Was it the department?And did they give you an idea why they needed to do extra?Okay.\", \"And I do have any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling back?So just tell me a little bit about what symptoms you\\'ve been having them but we do have a scan result here today and there\\'s some scuffs on it.I just like to make sure that I know what\\'s been happening to you first of all, and then we\\'ll go into detail Yeah.Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"And so do you still have pain at the abdomen?Okay.\", \"Well, as I said, you scan result has come through to me today.\", \"I\\'m afraid I\\'m afraid there is something that\\'s potentially a little bit worrying on it.Yeah.Well, if I take you back to the first scan first.\", \"So what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas glandYeah.\", \"So there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen, which is quite closely evolved, right, and called the pancreas.\", \"And when they did the ultrasound scan, which is a good scan, but isn\\'t particularly detailed, right, there was something on it that they saw that they wanted a bit more info So that\\'s why they called you back for the second scanwhich was a CT scan, which is a detail that we\\'re likely to be talking about.\", \"So the second scan, I showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas.When I say something, what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancerI\\'m really sorry to have to break it to you like this, but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you.\", \"So, I mean, I know that I\\'ve just dropped a big bombshell on you.Have you got any Any questions in a minute?\", \"Have you got anything that you can query?And it depends.\", \"And basically a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen, as I said, and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body prefers the body.\", \"Because it\\'s at the back of the abdomen, often we don\\'t know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem, like your pain that you\\'ve been getting.\", \"So that probably explains why you\\'ve not had many other symptoms.\", \"And the answer is, I don\\'t know what could be done about it.\", \"But we need to ask a specialist  what we usually do.\", \"This situation is asked especially today to see what has happened, think about what was cooking.\", \"Right?\", \"Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely isSo I understand that I\\'ve just thrown a whole lot of information at you andI mean, is there is there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them?\", \"Oh, quit I went on a bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you\\'ve had a bit.\", \"Bit more time.I mean, I think it\\'s important to say that we don\\'t know for definite what this is.\", \"We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what is right.\", \"So we do everything very quickly.\", \"Yeah, try and get some answers.\", \"Right.\", \"But we don\\'t know any definite nothing certain in a minute.\", \"But I do appreciate that.\", \"I\\'ve just given you a little bit of time.\", \"So my door is open and yes.\", \"Okay.\", \"Have you got any questions?I\\'ve taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer, if that\\'s what it is.\", \"some of it\\'s a little bit a little bit scary.\", \"And as I said, we don\\'t know, nothing certain yet.\", \"I wonder if you might want to come back to see me.\", \"So what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right?\", \"And it talks about cancer in general.\", \"The types of ways in which you can affect the pancreasHow we do it and how we work out what we do about it talks about the different types of scans that you\\'ve had and this one is CTS.And then depending on what they find, yeah, it gives you a brief run through of the different types of treatment.did you want to have a read through this and then Maybe tomorrow.I\\'ll see you tomorrow.Hi Miss Clark, My name is Alan Lime.\", \"I\\'m a social worker at the Family Health Center.\", \"Dr.\", \"Steele asked me if I would spend some time with you today.\", \"I\\'m really glad that you\\'re here.\", \"I\\'m just curious as to why he would send you to me.Yeah.\", \"So he, he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress.\", \"And he\\'s concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase And prior to prescribing anything, you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to thatOkay.\", \"So you filled in one of the Pink Sheets and I take a look at that.Okay, thank you.\", \"So, you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week, you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well.\", \"And that you have one or two drinks in one setting And maybe monthly you have more than that.\", \"What what\\'s what kind of drinks do you have?\", \"What do you do when you typically drinkSo it\\'s time to increase your strength a little more.\", \"Well, based on what you put here, you get it gives you six points on this scale scale ranging from zero to 46 points will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone.\", \"So if it\\'s okay with you to talk a little bit about that,okay.\", \"So that was sunset run zero to 40.\", \"It\\'s not a sort of super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there, or even stay there.\", \"This is a typical standard drink size over here, I\\'m not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine or not,maybe the little space it\\'s upset, perhaps a drink drink and a half each one.\", \"So that also increased a little bit more.\", \"So perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here.\", \"And for women, healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week, seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet, you\\'re perhaps already drinking more than that.\", \"So what do you make of all that?Yeah, it seems seems a little less than perhaps you\\'ve been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking.\", \"And certainly there\\'s there\\'s conflicting information out there about what\\'s healthy and what\\'s not healthy.\", \"Imagine the increased stress work because we\\'re concerned doctor seal as your stress increases, and if you were to describe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two, that would also be a concern for him.\", \"I would, I would think, so if you would, what is it that you like about alcohol?See, like the taste of it.\", \"And it does help to lower the stress, even if it\\'s just for the fun of me drinking.\", \"What\\'s not so good things about alcohol for you.your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you\\'re drinking.\", \"the drink introduce stress and increasing stress at the same time.\", \"So on the one hand, it low is it on the other hand, it\\'s increasing kind of the seesaw teeter totter effect.\", \"What do you make of that, given that on one hand, it lowers on the other hand, it increases and and now it\\'s increasing even more?Imagine investment thoughts so that what have you thought of trying?And he may be able to I\\'m not saying that he cannot just imagine that he\\'s concerned that if you continue to drink, the level that you are drinking, that whatever he prescribes you, there may be an interaction with it to mention that he\\'s concerned.\", \"I\\'m not completely sure.\", \"So you\\'ve had some success in the past of changing behaviors.\", \"And if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes.\", \"How important would it be for you on a scale of zero to 10?\", \"I have a low visual hero that if zero is not important, ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine.It\\'s it\\'s pretty up there.\", \"What do you choose a seven out of five or four?there\\'s a lot riding on your decision on what to do with this.\", \"What if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale?so so you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it.\", \"And if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do.How confident are you that you could do something about your drinking?Okay, so it\\'s pretty high up there again, and what if, what if anything, would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit?\", \"I\\'m just curious about thatSo you\\'d be willing to stop altogether.\", \"That\\'s what was indicated by the physician.\", \"Okay.\", \"So based on that, how ready are you to do anything right now, whether it\\'s to cut back whether it\\'s to quit?Okay, so that\\'s, that\\'s pretty hot there as well.\", \"It sounds as though you\\'re pretty motivated to do something about this right now, given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point.\", \"And just on lowering anxiety, in general, it sounds and that\\'s one of your goals as well.\", \"Well, I\\'m pretty confident Once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do, you\\'ll be able to follow through with it.\", \"Based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes.\", \"I mentioned some things that you can draw upon.\", \"What\\'s one thing that you could do?\", \"Imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress.one of the things we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life, this area of increased stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make an appointment for you for like before you leave today to talk to somebodythat also has some information here if you\\'re interested, some pamphlet on alcohol and and how what helps limits on how it may be affected by medications that you take as well.\", \"And I wish you lots of luck.\", \"It sounds as though you\\'re really committed to making this shift in this change.\", \"And I imagine doctors still want to follow up with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks.Again, I look forward to speaking to you in the future.Good morning Curtis.\", \"Good seeing you again.\", \"Go ahead and have a seat.\", \"How are feeling today?Okay, good.\", \"So So today\\'s your first visit would be today, were you okay with traffic?\", \"Did you find parking okay?Okay.\", \"Okay, I just wanted to interview I know you had some concerns you called me so we\\'re going to go over that today.\", \"What I wanted to do first of all was asked you what brings you here today to my office?\", \"What what kind of classes are you looking for what exactly?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right, are you right now today, Are you using any drugs today?right.\", \"What is your number one drug of choice right now?\", \"We wait okay now do you smoke with friends by yourself?Okay Do you find yourself doing it at home or do you go out?and do you feel that that\\'s something that you need to help you function or is it something that you like?Do you go smoke weed with other friends or by yourself?Right Okay, so I mean, do you feel that you need to function or helps you function better Or is it just something that you\\'re just experimenting with?\", \"Or what what exactly do youguide yourself spending a lot of money on?how much do you spend in a week or what your, your habit like right now?That\\'s, you know, pretty much equivalent to about maybe 10 to 10 to 15 hours a day.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, you know, you know, what we want to do is just be able to help you maybe create some some steps to help you begin to phase out in time, I wanted to pretty much identify the problem and that\\'s the marijuana would you say?\", \"Maybe there\\'s events in your life that trigger your use.\", \"Is there something that which I wanted to ask you?\", \"What are what\\'s your family structure like right now?So pretty much should have been raised by your foster parents and your biological parents are not independent.\", \"Okay.\", \"Now, in your family, how many siblings and your what and what What number are you using?\", \"so do you feel maybe there was added responsibility put on you or do you know that you live together?Right.\", \"And so your other four siblings?\", \"Where did they go?separate?You were raised by your foster parents And how do you feel about that?\", \"And how does that make you feel as far as foster?Okay.\", \"So they\\'re pretty much your biological sibs.\", \"And your, your, your foster parents are pretty much the ones that Rachel those are your parents.\", \"Okay.\", \"Then also, as you were, you know, living together at home, how are you disciplined?\", \"Or who are you disciplined by who discipline?So that was pretty much a consequence for your behavior equal to continental.\", \"Would you say that mom was consistent?\", \"she pretty much disciplined everybody.\", \"So growing up, do you feel that discipline helped you?\", \"kind of set some boundaries.Does your mother know that you smoke marijuana.Okay.\", \"The reason why I\\'m asking is because in order for us to help you, we want to be able to develop a good support system.\", \"So we want to, you know, maybe in time will include you know, your mom and let her know and you know, getting some help getting some treatment.\", \"But that was, you know, some of the questions I had for as far as you know, your family how you were raised.\", \"And now tell me a little bit about yourself when you were growing up, were you more of an introvert or an extrovert meaning, you know, without going or youthat kind of explains why you know, this conversation has gone well, you pretty much open Now, right now, hopefully British Columbia, you\\'re 20 years old.\", \"And do you have any girlfriend?\", \"And do you have How long have you known or how long have you been together ?So your past relationships pretty much haven\\'t been goodDid the your partners know that you were smoking or came out?Were you upfront with them or is it something they found out in there?\", \"They said, You know, I don\\'t want So some of your choices and some of your decisions that are a consequence, bad choices, decisions,okay.\", \"So what we want to do is we want to be able to identify, you know, your problem and that\\'s, you know, the marijuana use, maybe what triggers you to go use marijuana and then maybe then begin to identify some of the emotions that are behind it.\", \"But you know, you\\'ve grown up with six siblings that you all if you go to the same school or your different schools, that becomes a little bit about your, your school history.So you\\'re pretty close to her?Now in high school, how did that affect you being moved around seven times?\", \"What was your foster parent moving you?\", \"Did you move physically your house?\", \"right Yeah.\", \"So then you had to make a whole new set of friends.And that was the challenge with meeting new friends.\", \"Not knowing who You know your friends are what they do.\", \"Right?\", \"What are some of the subjects that maybe were that came easy to you that you enjoy that were you know what you did well and what some of the areas that you excelled inso spelling and reading are your strong points.\", \"Yeah, that kind of explains why you\\'re cute.\", \"You\\'re pretty good.\", \"As far as you know, being vocal, you\\'re okay.\", \"You\\'d like to talk to people, you engage well with people.\", \"So spelling English, what were some of the classes that maybe you didn\\'t really enjoy?\", \"Or you had a challenge withYeah, okay.\", \"All right.\", \"What was your relationship with your teachers?\", \"And maybe those that some of the peers that you had at the school?\", \"I mean, was there any?Okay.\", \"So overall today are you pursuing or do you want to further your educationRight.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Great.\", \"So you\\'re looking into for year junior college,And what would be like, give me a little bit during the time that you were in school.\", \"Did you have a job heavy work?You sent over to the restaurant.Okay.\", \"So you would prep everything, you know, all the tensile Ready?\", \"Okay.\", \"Now, when you were working, how did that make you feel when you\\'re working?but it was the start?Right.\", \"And so how did it make you feel good?\", \"Because you work for something And then the finished product was your paycheck.So if you want something in life, you pretty much have to work for it work for a car or not You have to work at a young age.\", \"How old were you when you started working?10 years old and then you started working and As a program for the school, so you know, you\\'ve known at a young age that it\\'s going to take hard work,Now, what about your dream job?\", \"What would be if tomorrow you could say, I\\'m gonna have this person tomorrow?\", \"Or this is my profession tomorrow?\", \"What would be your dream job?\", \"Wow.\", \"And when what was what\\'s your reasoning behind that?Tell me more about that.\", \"What would you do in your dream job?Fast in the air and being above Yeah, I think being able to see different view.\", \"So pilot Have you looked into what it would take to become a pilot.What is you next dream job?Police Officer, have you looked into that what it takes?right maybe that\\'s something we can discuss to help you find the cadet program close fine.\", \"We\\'re able to give you a, you know, some goals to set to get you in the program at that.\", \"But let\\'s look at you know, back, let\\'s back up a little bit to the marijuana.\", \"Because you and I know being in law enforcement, you know, marijuana and being a cop, pretty much And you would have to what would you have to do?So, what we want to do while you\\'re here, you know, we want to help you here develop a treatment plan and treatment model where you can pursue some realistic goals.\", \"We want to set some goals for you.\", \"Also, what about your medical History tongue a little bit about your medical history.\", \"Have you ever been in the hospital?\", \"Has anything ever happened to a broken boneWhat about in your family?\", \"Is there any diseases in your family and you want to know suffer for any illnesses, ailments.\", \"Okay.\", \"And as far as medical attention is there anyone that needs medical that needed medical attention in the past maybe someone on meds in your family psychological health?\", \"Was there anyone maybe that has gone to therapy that has been in therapy Your family and family memberAnd what we want to do, what I want to do to help you with this verse is one want to develop a treatment plan to help you with the marijuana use.\", \"We want to be able to look at your support system, you know who\\'s in your life right now?\", \"What are your friends that you smoke marijuana with?\", \"What type of people are they?\", \"Would this be a good fit for you?\", \"But our whole goal is to start you off with small steps.\", \"So today, you\\'re using marijuana how many times a day.\", \"So you pretty much said you use it every day.\", \"But how many times?Do you wake up and you do?so one of maybe one of the realistic goals is you\\'re okay you know we can we can narrow down maybe the relationship see which of your friends right now today?\", \"How many of them smokeYeah so maybe a realistic short term goal is to begin to see which friends to hang out with you know and then also your mom man either way sheso definitely we want to look at your whole peer relationships who your friends are We also want to look at your your time right now.\", \"So, you mentioned earlier that you were working.\", \"Are you working today?\", \"Okay, so maybe that\\'s another thing a realistic goal that we need to look at, and maybe help you pursue is it as a job?\", \"Maybe because the idle time sometimes can trigger events, you know, where you begin to want to use marijuana, and then we can identify some of the emotions that you\\'re feeling.\", \"Let\\'s go over that maybe briefly.\", \"Before you get before you smoke marijuana, is there a feeling that you have that says, hey, you depress, so we can look at the depression and see how we can treat that.\", \"What else?\", \"What are some of the other feelings that you see?what you think?Right?\", \"There\\'s a certain days that maybe perhaps you remember or eventsThat\\'s when you become angry.How you were brought up?So we want to we want to maybe will equip you with some coping skills, how to cope with those things, how to prepare you maybe for the holidays, maybe there\\'s a way we can, you know, we can begin to look at that.\", \"During the holidays.\", \"This is these are the emotions I feel.\", \"So we identify those emotions and we\\'ll be able to, you know, take care of that we\\'ll be able to prepare you prior to you are you falling back into the trap of going out and using marijuana Maybe during Christmas?\", \"Do you feel the same way during Christmas?Maybe even your birthday, Father\\'s Day, Mother\\'s Day, these are all things that we can kind of get you ready for.\", \"Because once again, it\\'s gonna take small steps, realistic goals.\", \"And then what we want to do after that the real estate goals is just get you ready, you know, for long term goal.\", \"But you know what, Curtis?\", \"I\\'m glad you came into my office.\", \"It was great meeting you.\", \"I look forward to working with you.\", \"Is there any other questions that you may have for me?\", \"Is there anything?What Well, we can do we\\'ll set you up with a treatment plan.\", \"And then I\\'d like to meet at least have two contacts with you your week.\", \"We can go over that.\", \"And then maybe during one of the context, we can help you with one, help you with a job.\", \"Okay?\", \"And then identifying some of the emotions.\", \"And then maybe we can get the whole marijuana use, we can begin to kind of taper it down instead of seven, you know, everyday.\", \"Yeah, we\\'ll begin to see how we can take with that.\", \"Okay, we\\'re down but again, I\\'m glad that you came.\", \"It was a pleasure meeting you and we\\'ll be in touch and we\\'ll be able to do it again.Hello there.\", \"My name is Dr.\", \"Betty.\", \"I\\'m one of the new GPS in the practice.\", \"First of all, what would you like me to call you?Okay, that\\'s fine.\", \"Okay, so, Barbara, I\\'m seeing you today.\", \"But I think it\\'s usually Dr.\", \"Brown that sees you.\", \"Is that right?Okay.\", \"What is it this boy you see me today?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?So quite a few symptoms and some of them sound more troublesome to you.And how long has this been going on?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?Okay.And What sort of treatments have you tried for this before?So these different tablets that you\\'ve got from the herbal shop, how are you taking them?\", \"So my my writing thinking you perhaps decide on a day to day basis, what you\\'re going to take depending on what your stomach\\'s doing.\", \"okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"And what About tests if you have any tests for these problems.they\\'re are the gastroscopy?Okay.Right.\", \"sounds as though you\\'re not happy with that?RightSo you feel as though actually enough hasn\\'t been done in the way.It sounds like you\\'ve had these problems now for about four years, you\\'ve you\\'ve got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach.\", \"You\\'ve tried a lot of tablets, some prescribed some herbal remedies, and you\\'ve had some investigations, but you\\'re not entirely happy that you\\'ve been investigated thoroughly enough.\", \"Is that is that about it?\", \"So I got the stor?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And can I ask you, Barbara, how is all of this affecting you day to day, how\\'s how\\'s it affecting your life?That\\'s something you quite enjoyed.Okay.rightYeah, it does, It does sound as though over the last few years, your life has really changed quite a lot because of the symptoms.\", \"It\\'s It sounds like you\\'re doing very few of the things that you used to do.\", \"What is it you spend your average day doing now?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"And have you been any times of the last four years that you\\'ve noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?Right.\", \"And how were you told me symptoms then?niceright, That\\'s interesting And are there any times when you Tommy symptoms bother you More seem particularly bad?so you notice it\\'s the worst when your husband\\'s not around.Right.\", \"Now, you\\'ve been seeing Dr.\", \"Brown about this for the last few years.\", \"What is it that he\\'s said that he thinks might be wrong here?Right Okay.\", \"Um, what do you think?And if you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing itrightSo you\\'re, you\\'re kind of prodding having a feel at night just to see if you can feel anything.Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So just to make sure that I\\'ve got the story straight you\\'ve, you\\'ve seen Dr.\", \"Brown for couple of years, you\\'ve tried a variety of medications, some prescribed some from the herbal shop, and none of them really made a great deal of difference.\", \"You\\'ve had some investigations, but you perhaps feel you\\'ve not had enough investigations.\", \"And times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer.\", \"Is that if I got the story, right,Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I\\'d do for you today?Right.\", \"Right.\", \"So you\\'re hoping that I\\'d send you four more tests?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Well, I think Barbara having having heard his story and heard about the symptoms, I\\'m not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you.\", \"And the reason for that is because you\\'ve you\\'ve had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and they\\'ve not shown anything.\", \"And you symptoms haven\\'t really changed that much.\", \"So it\\'s very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they\\'d show anything different than what we already know.\", \"So it\\'d be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.\", \"No, I think that you clearly have pain.\", \"And it clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability.\", \"I guess the way I think about these things is that they\\'re not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body.\", \"Sometimes these things can go together.\", \"I guess I\\'m thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married, and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and when your husband\\'s away, which is something you don\\'t like very much.\", \"Sometimes somehow his symptoms then will seem greater.\", \"So I guess what I\\'m wondering, Barbara is if the might be some kind of a link with you between how you feel In your mind and what\\'s going on in your life, and and how much you symptoms trouble you.\", \"Do you think that\\'s a possibility?I\\'m not saying that the pains in your mind.\", \"I guess what I\\'m saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms.\", \"Given that we\\'ve tried medication for you, and we\\'ve tried investigations, and we\\'ve drawn a blank really with those, none of those have really helped you.\", \"I guess I\\'m wondering whether now, it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life.\", \"I\\'m thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life\\'s really changed.\", \"It seems to have been Really shrunk down.\", \"And it sounds as though you\\'re not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of, is that right?And I guess I wonder it sounds as though you\\'ve you\\'ve dropped doing those things, because you felt you couldn\\'t do them.\", \"But I wonder if in a funny way, what\\'s happened is the fact that you\\'re not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment.\", \"And I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you?I guess what I\\'d be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day.\", \"And maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things.\", \"Even if it\\'s just meeting up with your female friends once a week.\", \"And whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life.\", \"I\\'m also thinking about the tablets that you\\'re taking.\", \"And the fact that you, you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it\\'s worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of these symptoms Worse, I guess.\", \"What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for, say, two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference?well, I guess, if we if we did decide to work together like this, this new approach, I\\'d be seeing you regularly, we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate proof They stay the same, then, you know, we could be pretty clear that there\\'s nothing new happening that that we\\'re missing.\", \"How would that sound?I think that would be a good idea.\", \"I think we\\'ve only just begun talk about it.\", \"And I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it, and then perhaps come back, perhaps if you booked him for a double slot next week.\", \"And that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach.\", \"And perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them.\", \"We can look at what you\\'re taking and perhaps go from there.\", \"How would that sound Barbara?Yes, I think so.\", \"I think that would be a good, a good start.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So see you again next weekAll right.\", \"Thank you Barbara.bye byeHello, Jane Evans.\", \"Hi, my name is Dr.\", \"Betty.\", \"I\\'m one of the psychologists who work here in the department of psychological medicine.\", \"And I\\'m seeing you today because you were referred up from a&e.\", \"I understand that you were there a couple of nights ago having cut your arms.\", \"I think that was you\\'d come in after, after the relationship ended.\", \"Is that right?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Can I just check of the bandage to open up a second down there?Okay, okay.\", \"How have you been Jane since we last saw ?Right.\", \"And this is Your boyfriend, Mark, is that right?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"How long have you two been together?Right.\", \"What was it that happened Jane to bring, bring that relationship to an end?So was it after he had gone that you cut?Right.\", \"Can you tell me a bit more about what happened when you cut?RightAnd did that help with the pain and the voices?So, with the cutting is this something that you\\'ve, you\\'ve done beforeRight.\", \"Okay.\", \"And it sounds like there are times when you do it when it it helps.RightRight.\", \"And are there any downsides to the cutting?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"And you mentioned Jain voices, And I know you\\'ve spoken to doctors about them before.\", \"but can I just ask you a few more questions about and please, if that\\'s okay.\", \"Okay, can you tell me?\", \"How long is it that you\\'ve been hearing the voices?And do you know other is, how many voices are there or who they are?Right.What kind of things Does your mom say?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And how often is it that you get these voicesRight.\", \"Did you think they were in the room?So can I just clarify that other voices seem as though they\\'re inside your head?\", \"Or was it like my voice coming through your ears?okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"And am I right in thinking that they they trouble you more at times when you get stressed out?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Can I ask you a few more general questions about how you are in your mood?\", \"How, how would you say that you, you feel generally kind of in yourself.Sounds as it can be very difficult sometimes.\", \"It sounds like you\\'ve used cutting in the past to help are there any of the things that you do to help when you feel really bad.Okay, and that was in the past, but but not recently.And can I ask Jane, it sounds like when you cook the other night, you were doing it, sort of to kind of get rid of the pain.\", \"Can I just clarify where you\\'re doing it to try and kill yourself.Okay.\", \"Have there ever been times in the past when you have tried to kill yourself?So that was in your late teens and at the time you took the tablets because you wanted to be dead.\", \"Is that right?Okay.\", \"Okay, but you\\'ve not wanted to be dead since that time in your late teens?\", \"Okay.\", \"Can I ask a few more general questions about your home situation?\", \"Who is it Is it is there anyone at home with you?Right?\", \"So she\\'s gone to live with her dad that quite recentlyand what was what was that about?the relationships you had?Can you tell me a bit more about that?Right.\", \"And it sounds like your daughter struggled with that.Okay.\", \"Well, there are lots of relationships like that.\", \"Okay.\", \"You\\'ve seen Jane a few people in the past you\\'ve seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors.\", \"As anything that anyone\\'s done for you before been particularly helpful.So you\\'ve not found anything that people have done particularly helpful in helping you to manage your relationships and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you.what do you think it would be worse?\", \"Given that this this has been such a long standing problem clearly does get gets in the way, quite a lot of aspects of your life.\", \"Do you think it would be worth us?\", \"meeting again one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this?Well, the way that we work here in this department is that we we see people once or twice and try and think with them about the best place for them to be and then refer them on to the most appropriate parts of the service.\", \"So it wouldn\\'t be usual for me to see.\", \"See you more than once or twice StrainI know it\\'s very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you\\'re not going to continue to see me but it is the way that we work here is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs Jane.\", \"So would it be okay for me to book you in to come back and see me say next week for a second appointment and we can perhaps have a think of where to go from there.Hi, Andy Jones, come on in, have a seat.\", \"I\\'m Dr.\", \"Taylor.\", \"I\\'m the Encore psychiatrist for this afternoon.\", \"I got a call this morning from your family doctor, because I think you went to see him this morning along with your mum.\", \"And I know that things have been a little bit difficult for you had some other distressing experiences.\", \"So I think your doctor thought it might be helpful for us to have a bit of a discussion about that, to see if I could help.\", \"Would that be right with you?Would it be all right handy for you to tell me a little bit about what\\'s been going on?Right.Okay, that must be very difficult for you.How long has this been going on for Andy?right And how did you first work out this is what was happening?um, what was it that you knew at that moment?\", \"right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So it\\'s been going on a couple of months.okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Now I\\'ve noticed a couple of times while we\\'ve been talking to you sort of look around you into the room as if you checking for something could ask you what\\'s happening at those times.Who is it You can hear?Right.\", \"So that you recognize it as their voices?\", \"Right, How many voices Can you hear Andy?Okay.\", \"And do they sound real, Like my voice sounds talking to you now?so when they\\'re not in the house with you?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"And can you hear what they\\'re actually saying?Can you give me an example of what they would say?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Anything else?\", \"Do they ever talk to each other Perhaps about you?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"What about actually talking directly to you in the way that I\\'m talking to you now?\", \"Does that ever happen Andy?Okay, so you\\'ve been you\\'ve been hearing the voices of your housemates Have there been any other changes have there been any changes perhaps to the way you\\'re thinking?\", \"Sometimes people tell us that they thinking changes in some way.\", \"So for example, they might feel that they\\'re getting thoughts put into their head that aren\\'t their own.\", \"had any experiences like that?so different thoughts in your brain.It\\'s not your kind of thing normally, right?\", \"Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And do you have any idea how that that\\'s happening who is responsible?Okay.\", \"So you\\'re getting thought put into your brain that aren\\'t your own?\", \"What about a different sort of experience?\", \"What about the experience that somehow other people are able to know what you\\'re thinking even though you haven\\'t actually told them?And can I just check on it as well?\", \"That you\\'re not getting the experience when your thoughts just stop all together?\", \"Like you have no thoughts left.Okay.\", \"Okay.You mentioned this, this chip or this device in your brain, you want to tell me a bit more about that.You can feel the physical sensation in your breainokay.\", \"Okay, that must be very difficult for youOkay.\", \"Can I just check Are there any problems Andy with the rest of your body any changes in sensation or any bits that feel different in any way?It sounds like a very difficult time for you.\", \"Can I ask you Andy, how are you coping with all this?\", \"How\\'s it affecting you?\", \"Okay, what do you think\\'s happening to your food?Okay, are you actually eating much at the moment?\", \"Okay, and with all this happening and this says that you don\\'t feel very safe I\\'ve got that right.\", \"Okay, haveyou felt the need to know to take steps to protect yourself in any way?\", \"right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Have you felt the need to use either the knife or the baseball bat so far to take it out with you for protection?Okay.\", \"Has it ever got so bad Andy that you felt the need to hurt yourself or even kill yourself as the only way out the only way of coping with it?even when you say getting some pills, that\\'d be to take an overdose of tablets?but you\\'ve not actually done anything about that so far?\", \"right?Okay.\", \"In the past have you ever had any problems either with your temper or getting into fights being aggressive either with your housemates or anybody else?And can I just check again you\\'ve not been in trouble with the police or anything like that.Okay.\", \"With all this that\\'s going on.\", \"Is there any way at the moment Andy That you feel safe?right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And have you seen much of your parents recently?And throughout this last couple of months when you\\'ve had all these worries, have you ever worried that your parents might in some way be involved in this conspiracy?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Can I just check out a couple of background things with you, Andy, your general health is that okay Generally fit and well?\", \"And you\\'re not on any regular medication from your own doctor at this stage.Okay.\", \"What about other drugs And by that I\\'m meaning alcohol cannabis pills, Anything else?Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"And what about drugs like cannabis?I think it\\'s important I hear about this is wouldn\\'t be something we\\'d be discussing with your mom.Would that be regularly to most days?And how much would you be spending on weed?Okay, so you have a 10 buck lesson you have a day of weed any other drugs?\", \"I\\'m thinking in particular things like speed or or pills.Okay.\", \"Its on a regular basis Andy?Okay, when was the last time I didn\\'t even had any speedOkay, any other drugs at all?\", \"Okay, I guess the reason I was checking I think we\\'ve picked up on is sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are they find if they take certain drugs, it could make things feel a lot worse.\", \"I just wanted to check.\", \"that hadn\\'t been your experience.Okay, okay.\", \"Appreciate from what you\\'re saying, You\\'re really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that\\'s the cause of the difficulties that you\\'re having at the moment.\", \"I just wanted to check with you Do you think it could be due to anything else?\", \"And I mean, I\\'ve obviously met other people who\\'ve had similar experiences, and sometimes they\\'re extremely stressed, some people might be mentally unwell, and it\\'s worth it whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment.Alright.Okay.\", \"Sure, I think I can appreciate that.\", \"I guess what I\\'m wondering is whether you think there\\'s anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful.\", \"Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment?Well, I certainly believe that you\\'re having a really difficult time at the moment, I guess I\\'m not too sure about is what\\'s causing this and I\\'m, I\\'m less sure this is due to MI5 is what I\\'m wondering, is it perhaps you\\'re not as well as you might be at the moment.\", \"I mean, we\\'ve been through a lot of questions And what I\\'m thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this Someone drink cuz I know your mom is I think she\\'s waiting in the waiting room might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some some proper support.\", \"Would that be alright if I got your mum in?okay, if you want to sit there then I\\'ll just get your mum okay.Hi, Lisa, how you doing?Yeah, I\\'m aware you have some symptoms that have been bothering you.\", \"You tell me about those.ADHD.Alright, so we\\'ll, we\\'ll talk about that.\", \"Let me ask you a few quick questions before we we get to that.\", \"Do you ever feel depressedor anxious?and in trouble with drugs or alcohol?Nothing like that.\", \"Okay.?Why do you think you have have ADHD?so, so trouble establishing attention?\", \"How about difficulty in holding attention?\", \"Like once you have established it?Trouble with both?Alright.\", \"And you mentioned the word distracted.So you find yourself easily distracted?\", \"Yeah, you do.\", \"Okay.How about well give me an idea of the setting.\", \"So, is this at work or school?It\\'s everywhere.Right.\", \"So, do you work?\", \"Do you go to school?How old are you?24.\", \"All right.\", \"And this problem with the attention affects you at work.at a school and you said everywhere.You\\'re 24.\", \"Now, when did you first notice the potential problems?You\\'ve had it for a long time?How about how disturbing is like, How much is it interfering with your functioning?It\\'s really problematic.\", \"Wow.\", \"All right.Okay, so I\\'m going to ask you a few other questions here.\", \"We talked about the attention.\", \"So it\\'s hard for you to give attention and hold attention.\", \"How about listening?\", \"Let\\'s Let\\'s go with the school environment for now.\", \"Let\\'s talk about school.\", \"How about listening in class?That\\'s not a problem for you.How about following instructions?Tell me about your organizational skillsvery organized?Do you find yourself avoidingactivities that require a lot of mental investment?Until energy?Do to move toward those types of activities.to ever find yourself losing things that you need to complete different jobs or tasks.Okay, I\\'m gonna change gears and ask you some other questions around a different area.\", \"Do you ever find yourself like fidgeting?\", \"tough to stay still?no.\", \"In school, and we\\'ll get we\\'ll cut stick with the school.\", \"environment.\", \"Do you find it difficult to stay seated?How do you do when you are engaging in a quiet activity?You\\'re okay with that.you know find yourself wandering off.Did you ever feel like, again internally there\\'s a motor running and you can\\'t shut it off.How about being talkative Do you find yourselfRight.\", \"So you feel like you\\'d talk a lot?\", \"And that you interrupt.Yes.People in a situation where it would be traditional to like, wait, in line or wait your turn.\", \"Do you find that\\'s difficult for you?\", \"no.\", \"Do you ever find yourself like, for example in class, just saying something?\", \"Like blurting something out without giving it much thought?All right.\", \"I think I have what I need here.\", \"And I want to get you in to see a counselor.if that works for you, because you did mention this was affecting your function.\", \"I want to I want to make sure you get to see a counselor.\", \"It\\'ll just take a couple days to get you in to see somebody that works for you.Yeah, I appreciate you taking this time with me.\", \"This information has been helpful.\", \"Thanks, .Hello, Judy Thomas.\", \"Hello there.\", \"My name is Dr.\", \"Beji.\", \"I\\'m one of the new GP in the practice.\", \"And I\\'m seeing you today instead of Dr.\", \"Jones, who\\'s your usual GP?First of all, what would you like me to call you?\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"But Julie, so what is it that\\'s bought you to see me today?Yeah, I understand that you\\'ve been in to see him a few times over the last few months.\", \"Would you mind if I asked you to go over again what the problem is perhaps in your own words, so that I get an understanding of it.\", \"and you\\'re feeling a little bit anxious just here with me.Take your time.\", \"Okay.\", \"So your heart starts to race really beats really fast and you feel like you can\\'t catch your breath.How long has all this been going on for Julie?Okay.\", \"And can you remember what happened to start it all off?Right.\", \"So that sounds like quite an unpleasant experience.and when that was happening to Julie, when you\\'re in the middle of town, what was it that you thought was going on?\", \"Right Okay.So what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding?and other things, what sort of things you are not doing?Okay.\", \"I guess I\\'m wondering if you\\'re talking about your sex life there.Right.So you\\'re avoiding sex in case that puts your heart rate up.Okay, How\\'s that affecting things between you and your husband?It sounds like he\\'s getting to the end of his tether because it also sounds like you\\'re pretty fed up with the whole thing as well.\", \"JulieSo just so that I\\'ve got the story straight.\", \"This all began about six months ago.\", \"Before that, had you had anything like this?\", \"So just to make sure I\\'ve got the right the right way around.\", \"It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town you had the first of these attacks.\", \"And then since then you\\'ve had some more and now it\\'s kind of got to the point that you don\\'t want to go out to don\\'t get to town by yourself.\", \"You know, you don\\'t go to the pub, not socializing like you used to and you avoiding things like exercise and things like sex and having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"And looking at your I know, you\\'ve had an ECG, Dr.\", \"Jones, organized for you a couple of months ago.\", \"What have you been told about the results of that?So even though the your GP told you there\\'s no, there\\'s nothing to worry about with your heart.\", \"Do you still worry that There might be something wrong with your heart?I think I agree with Dr.\", \"Jones.\", \"I don\\'t think there is anything wrong with your heart.\", \"The reason I say that is that you\\'ve had an ECG, which has come back perfectly normal.\", \"And usually if there was a problem with the heart the ECG would pick something up.\", \"Also, you\\'ve got none of the risk factors really for heart disease, because you you don\\'t smoke, your blood pressure, from what I can gather from you notes has always been fine.\", \"You\\'re fairly young.\", \"Before this, you were pretty fit and active.\", \"And also, I know you\\'re worried about your dad having had a heart attack, but actually, he was a lot older than you are.\", \"And so you\\'re not really in the same risk sort of bracket as he would have been.\", \"So I don\\'t think that there is a problem with your heart.\", \"I guess what I\\'m what Is weather actually, what\\'s going on is a little bit more what Dr.\", \"Jones thought weather actually this, this might be the anxiety that\\'s giving you a lot of these symptoms.\", \"Have you ever thought it might be that rather than a heart problem?It\\'s right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Has anyone explained to about anxiety and panic attacks?Okay, well, perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear a little bit more about that.\", \"What we have on top of our kidneys is two little glands and they called our adrenal glands.\", \"And they produce a hormone called adrenalin.\", \"Have you heard of that?okay.\", \"And what adrenalin does is it prepares us for situations of fight or flight?\", \"Is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school?you remember what we mean by fight or flies?YeahYes, exactly.\", \"It\\'s what\\'s released to allow you to do the flight or fight response in the adrenaline.\", \"So when your body needs to get ready to do something, it\\'s surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action.\", \"So it does things like it puts your heart rate up, it makes your breathing speed up, you\\'re ready to run.\", \"It can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry.\", \"It can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded.\", \"But those are the kinds of symptoms that you can get.What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens the first adrenaline release Out of the blue, perhaps at times of stress, and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, and you\\'re feeling a bit stressed out and you\\'re in town, it was a bit hot.\", \"So that may have been what was behind that very first panic attack.\", \"What happens to people is that once they\\'ve had one panic attack, they go on to have more.\", \"And the reason for that is that once you\\'ve had something like that happen to you, you\\'re kind of there thinking, Oh, will this happen again?\", \"Yeah, you describing it Exactly.\", \"Julie, that\\'s what we call hyper vigilance.\", \"So you they\\'re kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart.\", \"And for most of us, our heart rate will go up and down all through the day, but most of us don\\'t worry about it, because we don\\'t notice it.\", \"But because you\\'ve had a panic attack you they\\'re thinking, What\\'s my heart doing?\", \"And then the minute it starts to change, you clock it You notice it, and then you start to get anxious thoughts, you might worry AndRight, So you get those kinds of anxious and they\\'re very frightening, because you\\'re thinking, Oh, my goodness me could my heart\\'s on that makes you even more anxious, and that causes even more adrenalin to be released.\", \"And that makes the symptoms even more pronounced.\", \"And then that makes you believe even more that there\\'s something wrong with you.\", \"Does that make sense to what might be happening?One of the things that you have been doing, which is something that a lot of people with anxiety do is that you\\'ve started to, to avoid doing things that trigger it off.\", \"Exactly.\", \"And whilst in the short term that sort of alleviates your symptoms, because you don\\'t have to get panicky, what\\'s happening is that the more you avoid doing things, the less likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful, really happens.\", \"Does that make sense?Well, if we all started to tackle this as if it was an anxiety problem, there are a number of approaches, we can think about tablets.\", \"And we\\'re gonna think about other kind of talking approaches.\", \"There are pros and cons to those and side effects and things that we need to discuss.\", \"So I\\'m just slightly watchful of the time, we seem to be coming to the end of today\\'s session for the appointment, but all right, well, I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week, and look again, more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best.\", \"how would that sound?Any other questions before we end this sessionI\\'ll see you next week.Pleasure.\", \"All right.Hi, Miss Jones.\", \"I\\'m Jane Corona.\", \"I\\'m a medical student with university hereI\\'ve been sitting by Dr.\", \"Smith is part of our treating as a medical student to do an interview with you.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then I\\'ll take that information back to Dr.\", \"Smith And then she will come back in and see you then after thatAll right.\", \"How may I address you?All right.\", \"Thank you.\", \"Um, is that okay with you today to talk?I\\'m going to start out today by just talking a little bit with you about your chief complaint What brings you here today?Okay, before we talk a little bit more about that, is there anything else that you want to talk with either me or Dr.\", \"Smith today?Okay.\", \"Tell me more about this pain.and tell me when did it start for you?And you describe the pain is throbbing.\", \"Is there anything else about the pain in terms of the quality of the pain that you want to describe for me?okay, started about a week to two weeks ago.\", \"Okay.\", \"And do you recall what you were doing at the time that it started?Okay.\", \"Umm I would like to hear about a little bit about the severity of it on a pain scale of one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you\\'ve ever had one or zero being no pain at this, How bad is this pain?Okay.\", \"And is it a six or seven all the time?Okay.\", \"And how often a day does that happen?Do you notice any pattern to that at all?Okay.\", \"All righty.\", \"And can you point exactly to Where it is for me the location exactly?And does that pain go up your arm or down your arm or anywhere else on your arm?Is there anything else that goes on at the same time?\", \"Any other symptoms that happen anything else other than when the pain is happening there anything else going on for you?Is there anything that makes it feel better?And how much time it will do take?is that regular strength or extra strength?You just take it across the counter to normal directions on the bottom.Okay.\", \"And does anything make it worse?So using it.Have you seen anybody else for this complaint?Have you What else have you tried other than the Tylenol and anything else?Okay.\", \"It sounds you\\'ve talked a little bit about how it\\'s impacted, you know, you to be able to work in the garage or do the dishes or lift your child is there Other impact on your life,Does it wake you up at night?Okay.\", \"What do you think it is?All right.\", \"What I\\'d like to do now is just kind of go through all the things that you told me and summarize for you.\", \"This is information that I want to take that but I want to make sure that I have it all correct.\", \"So if I\\'ve forgotten something, or I\\'ve gotten something incorrect, please, please help me.\", \"You came to the clinic today for a complaint of left elbow pain, and it\\'s pain that you mostly noticed when you were bending it or using it in some capacity.\", \"It\\'s a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day, which you notice about is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that\\'s when it seems to be at its worst.\", \"It\\'s gone on for about a week, maybe two, two weeks when you think back on it, and it started out when you were helping your husband clean the garage and you were lifting locks of boxes.\", \"So about a six to seven on a pain scale.\", \"And you describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it\\'s getting kind of in the way of doing some things that you want to you report that it happens probably two to three times a day, and that the pain wraps around the joint.\", \"Completely, you\\'ve taken some Tylenol for it across the counter, you\\'ve taken that several times a day now with without much reliefthat it hasn\\'t helped much.\", \"You\\'ve also tried a heating pad, you\\'ve tried some ice, that hasn\\'t really helped either too much.\", \"It sounds like you know, again, you kept referring to it as an as a nuisance.\", \"It\\'s just kind of getting in the way of your daily activities.\", \"It Doesn\\'t necessarily keep you up at night.\", \"But you do notice it at night when you wake up that it\\'s still going on for you.\", \"So sleep doesn\\'t seem to help much.\", \"And that what you mostly think this could be is a pulled muscle of some type.\", \"Is there anything I forgotten or that you wanted to tell me about this?Thank you for telling me about your chief concerns.\", \"So I\\'m going to take it back to Dr.\", \"Smith.Erica, how you doing today?\", \"You\\'re doing good?so we have a part that wants to settle down, a part that wants to keep going with the career so For this to chair, what I like to do is in the chair where you\\'re seated now, this will be the emotional self, in this case, the side that wants to pursue the career.\", \"Yeah, myself before that seems like we\\'re more that\\'s what I really want.\", \"Yes, you\\'re more emotionally connected.\", \"That\\'s what you want.\", \"That\\'s what I want.\", \"So this will be the side of you, that has the needs and the wants, and more the emotion.\", \"Okay, so that\\'s who you\\'ll be in this chair.\", \"That makes sense.\", \"In the other chair, let\\'s have the critic that\\'s inside that internal critic.\", \"That\\'s advocating for settling down for getting married for having kids.\", \"In a way it represents a societal pressure Did those two sides seem separate to you?\", \"You feel like you can be the emotional self here, an internal critic there?So, I think you remember how this work she\\'ll be, he\\'ll be talking to this case the internal critic, right?\", \"So the internal critics on the side of settling down, getting married.\", \"And then when you\\'re ready to have the critic respond, you\\'ll switch that chair and respond to the emotional needs driven and wanting some make sense.\", \"Okay.\", \"So whenever you\\'re ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic.So you\\'ve made your statement.\", \"Are you ready to switch?\", \"Okay, good switch.\", \"So I use the internal critic.an internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case, the career side, been selfish.\", \"And notice your posture is very linear and you\\'re upright.\", \"I noticed you kind of put your hand down a little bit when you\\'re talking.\", \"Try to think of the internal critics, body movements.\", \"Try to act that out a little bit.\", \"Okay.You\\'re gonna jump at the emotional side?So that\\'s the internal critic, they respond back to the term critic from the emotional side.\", \"okay.\", \"So the internal critic is just called a selfish and one of the things is a response.Let me interrupt you.\", \"So your hands are pointing back toward the career emotional self.\", \"What can you do with your hands that really embody that you want to communicate to the internal critic?\", \"Is there anything else you want to do?So continueand have used that motion there.\", \"You\\'re, you\\'re pushing the internal critic away.\", \"Okay.does the internal critic have something to say back?So you\\'ve you\\'ve now pushed the emotional side is pushed the critical way.Alright, so internal critic is that hands down here is the internal critic.\", \"Right?\", \"It\\'s an internal critic less angry, less assertive,So the critic is more separated now maybe a little bit but also has a different outlook.So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination.to move back to the emotional?So at the end of this conflict, after we split into two parts here, they have this conflict is eventually a decision is a decision to pursue a career or settle down.\", \"Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision?So that\\'s, that\\'s really been your decision all along.\", \"But the internal critic was harassing you this whole time?\", \"And today you\\'re able to kind of shove that internal critic back a little.\", \"And allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with the decision you\\'ve made.do you feel is helpful technique?So he was able to give you some clarity.Right.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, let\\'s once reflect on what\\'s happened here, between now and the next session, okay, Bye, guys.\", \"Kind of a lot happened.\", \"And it seems like you\\'ve gained clarity for your decision.\", \"And then we\\'ll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with.\", \"See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back.\", \"And if you have more peace with a decision, that\\'s not like a plan.How you doing today?What\\'s going on?like ADHD.\", \"That\\'s the one you think you might have ADHD?Alright, so let me ask you some other questions, and then we\\'ll get into some questions specifically about that and see what\\'s going on there.\", \"Do you ever find yourself depressed or anxious?A trouble with drugs or alcohol?Nothing like that.\", \"When did you first Notice you had the symptoms?Do you Do you know what age?All right.\", \"But you\\'re thinking early teens maybe before?Do the symptoms of a really bothersome to you that caused me.Yeah.\", \"What kind of areas they cause you problems?Do do you work?this cause problems at work?How about college?Okay.\", \"Have it at home?Good.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So tell me a little bit about the symptoms that you think might indicate ADHD.\", \"What\\'s going on?So you feel compelled to, to stand up in class?\", \"Even though you know, it might draw some attention.Alright, so I\\'m going to ask you a few questions.\", \"And as you can have two categories of questions.\", \"so let\\'s start with the first category.\", \"Do you feel like you have trouble establishing intention?\", \"And let\\'s, let\\'s look at this in terms of school?\", \"you do.\", \"Okay.\", \"How about when you have established attention Do you find yourself struggling to hold on to it?And again, I\\'ll just stick with the school environment.\", \"Right.\", \"That\\'s a place to be symptoms bother.\", \"Well, that\\'s cool.\", \"Again, they bought other places, but that\\'s a big issue?Okay.\", \"Do you have trouble listening in class?you do.\", \"How about following through on instructions that are provided by say the professor?Do you do you find yourself organized?pretty organized.Do you find yourself in school or other settings, avoiding activities that require a lot of mental effort?What are some things you avoid?\", \"Oh,They were find yourself losing things that you need to to function at work or school.distracted??fairly easily?How about forgetfulness?Okay, so I\\'m gonna move and ask you another category of questions.Okay.\", \"How do you find yourself?\", \"fidgeting?How do you deal with I think you touched on this before, but I did it with quiet activities.\", \"Like for example, reading.You start with that?\", \"Yeah.So when you are engaged in quiet activities, do you find yourself kind of wandering off?you do.\", \"feel like you have an internal motor that won\\'t shut off?No.\", \"Okay.Do you feel like you talk excessively?What settings to find that\\'s a problem.That\\'s a big one?Do you ever find that same class you blurt things out?do you interrupt people?have a situation where, like, say at work or school or at home, where you have to wait your turn for something.\", \"Do you find that subproblem?It could be a drive thru dude.\", \"If your drive thru Do you find?You don\\'t have any trouble with like waiting in lines or waiting for your turn?\", \"I guess not.\", \"It\\'s not okay.\", \"Okay.All right.\", \"So I\\'m gonna get you in to see one of our counselors, you mentioned that these symptoms are bothersome to you.\", \"And I want to make sure you get treated.\", \"We\\'ll take a couple days to get you in to see somebody that okay, So I want to thank you for spending this time with me and answering these questions.\", \"This has been really helpful.Thanks.How you doing today?doing pretty good.like college?ADHD?that one that you may have ADHD.Alright, is it these symptoms bothering you?\", \"You said you go to college online.It was bothering you there?It does.\", \"Alright.\", \"I\\'m going to ask you a few questions to try to get a better understand what\\'s going on.\", \"Okay.\", \"These symptoms you\\'ve been having, what age did they start?\", \"eight years old.\", \"All right.\", \"And you feel like they\\'re bothering you.\", \"With your classes that you take online?get good grades for?Somebody asked you some questions about that.\", \"So I\\'ll specifically be asking about how it affects you in class, but affects you in any other area.\", \"Tell me about that, too.\", \"All right.\", \"Do you have trouble establishing attention?When you have established attention, do you have difficulty holding attention?for example, with a professor, do you listen to the professor Your Online classes.\", \"that\\'s a problem for you.\", \"How about following through on any instructions that professor gives you?Are you organized?Do you find yourself avoiding activities that require a lot of mental effort?Do you know what type of activities to avoid.Do you ever find yourself losing things that you need for class or any other placeAre you easily distracted?Are you forgetful?Yeah.\", \"All right.So I\\'m going to move to another series of questions.Do you fetch it.Do you find it difficult to stay in your seat?Okay, so you feel kind of compelled to stand up and walk around.\", \"And then you can sit down and resume.How do you do with quiet activities like reading?No,All right.\", \"Here feel like you have an internal motor that\\'s always running.How about talking?\", \"Do you find that you talk excessivelyHow about blurting things out?so that I get on and the audio turns on.\", \"So you\\'ll you\\'ll blurt something out, but they won\\'t hear it.\", \"Yeah, they won\\'t because you haven\\'t.So I guess that\\'s good.Okay.\", \"How about interrupting people?Yes.\", \"Do you have trouble waiting Your turnThat\\'s not not a strong suit for you.\", \"No,Okay, so you mentioned that This is causing some difficulty in school but you also said that you\\'re doing okay in school.\", \"Yeah.\", \"All right.\", \"Is there any other area of your life for this is causing your problems?Not not I can think of.\", \"No.Yeah.\", \"What else do you do?\", \"So you go to college?\", \"Have aany friends?It\\'s kind of embarrassing, but really don\\'t have any friends.\", \"Just kind of live, eat and breathe school.Do you ever socialize with any of your classmates from college?Yeah.\", \"Do you feel that\\'s because of these symptoms?\", \"Or that you wouldn\\'t anyway?Well, I feel bad about it.\", \"So I mean, it\\'s hard for me to to get over it cuz I notice it, but it\\'s hard for me to get out there.Right.\", \"Do you think it\\'s hard for you to engage with your classmates socially, because of any concentration or hyperactivity type symptoms?\", \"you believe it is because the symptomsAnd any other areas like, like shopping or clean house?\", \"That works out.\", \"Okay.All right.\", \"Okay, at least I\\'m going to get you in to see a counselor or just take a couple days to get In my starting point for a couple days out, I appreciate you spending this time with me.\", \"And let me ask these questions.\", \"This was helpful.\", \"ThanksI saw the thing that your name is Elizabeth, and I\\'m not sure if that\\'s what you go by, All right, great.\", \"So this one of the things I wanted to talk with you about is I know that you did some assessments over the last couple of days.\", \"And so I want to talk with you about that and just talk with you about kind of treatment and how things are going to go.\", \"And based on that sounds like the what, from what you were saying in terms of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder, it\\'s called bulimia nervosa, and I\\'m not sure if you\\'ve ever heard of that.So what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit.\", \"So what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you\\'ve lost control and you feel, you know, like overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly.\", \"And there are times to when you, you know, you\\'re maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight.\", \"And that feel familiar to you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So and then it sounds like that\\'s been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week.So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it\\'s not unusual.\", \"For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this.\", \"In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, so it\\'s not unusual.\", \"One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting.\", \"So like going for long periods of time without eating and sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively.\", \"Yeah,One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle.\", \"And we know that that\\'s the case.\", \"The other thing that we\\'re aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report a lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they\\'re feeling or managing feelings.\", \"Is that something that you\\'ve experienced?\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, that\\'s okay.\", \"Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that.\", \"And so we know that there\\'s a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc.\", \"So one of the things that I like to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals like yourself is I take an approach it\\'s called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there\\'s a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you\\'ve been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake.\", \"And so what I\\'d like to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you\\'ve had, you know, overeating episodes and when you\\'ve restricted your calories, when you\\'ve You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things like that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we\\'ll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we\\'re together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating.\", \"So how\\'s that sound?\", \"Okay.\", \"And there\\'s really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we\\'re going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you\\'ll you\\'ll know pretty quickly that you\\'re gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it\\'ll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating.\", \"Okay, great.\", \"So this is what I\\'d like to do is first of all, first of all, let\\'s start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where like just recently within the last couple days where you\\'ve had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that.\", \"And then what I\\'d like to do is and we\\'ll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that.\", \"So and then then what we\\'ll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we\\'ll, we\\'ll start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present.\", \"And I\\'ll just ask you a lot of questions and we\\'ll, you know, kind of go from there.\", \"Right?\", \"So why don\\'t you tell me the Tell me like a recent episode, that where you felt like that you\\'d lost control.\", \"You\\'re eatingOkay.\", \"Did you been restricting your your food?\", \"You know, for the prior to that or you\\'ve been dieting prior to that?I\\'m meant to tell you to I like to take a lot of notes at least initially so I have a good sense of what\\'s going on.\", \"So what else was going on?\", \"Okay, so it sounds like Saturday night out with friends.\", \"See person that you like that you\\'ve just say you dated some?Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"I\\'m sorry.\", \"Okay, so you\\'re kind of interested.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And then you sounds like what you were, then you began to feel more concerned about how you were how you looked at how your outfit felt.\", \"Yeah.Okay.\", \"And so that then, then what\\'s then what happened then is that you go back to the apartment foods there.\", \"And then you kind of sat down on the couch and you felt like that you\\'d lost control.Okay.\", \"It\\'s just kind of a typical scenario.Okay.\", \"And then um, so you went home to the apartment.in school, and what are you working on?Yeah.\", \"Because I was thinking about the time of the year, so Coming up or any projects coming up, so, anything big on the horizon for you?\", \"okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.sounds like it.\", \"Um, what\\'s your roommates name?\", \"Kathy.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So then Kathy has a roommate over quite often this last week she was they were there quite a bit boyfriend, her boyfriend.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then you\\'re trying to study and did you talk with them about that in terms of the noise or that bothering you?Sounds like you feel like that you\\'ve tried to let her know in various ways that you know, you\\'ve got something coming up and that you\\'d like to study and when it\\'s quiet and you\\'d like to be able to focus but that the sounds like that.\", \"They\\'re kind of constant commotion is really distressing to you, right?\", \"If you talk with her, like one to one about How that bothers you or that that\\'s a real problem for you.\", \"Okay, she know what\\'s hard about doing that, in terms of talking with her.Okay.\", \"All right, that makes sense.\", \"Okay.Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay, that\\'s helpful.Middle School, 12 or 13 years old.\", \"Um, good.\", \"So we\\'ll start from there.\", \"Tell me about your.\", \"Tell me about your parents.Okay, so your mom and dad divorced when you were 10.\", \"Okay, and so, alright, so let me Okay, that\\'s helpful.\", \"And then you say your mom got remarried.You haven\\'t any siblings?Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"And is that a boy or a little sister?\", \"What\\'s her name?\", \"Brooke.\", \"Okay, so mom remarried.\", \"What\\'s your stepdad same?\", \"Bruce.\", \"Bruce.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So, Mom and Bruce.\", \"They have a little girl and her name is Brooke.\", \"Okay, how old is Brooke.\", \"Okay, six.\", \"Oh, she\\'s six.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.kind of do you have a sense about what led up to the divorce or what was going on?Okay.\", \"Then Then.\", \"So then they divorced when you were 10.\", \"And so then how soon after, did your mom marry a Bruce?under two years.\", \"Okay.\", \"How was that for you to have her remarry so quickly?During the, during that period of time, because I know you talked about middle school, but during the period of time when they were having difficulties with their marriage.\", \"What was your, you know, your eating like?\", \"or How are you managing that during that time in terms of your feelings about the night?\", \"Ah.Were you talking to anybody or you know, anybody?\", \"reasonable.\", \"Did anybody else know what was going on?\", \"Or?And she was aware of what was happening.Okay, even at that time, and sounds like that.\", \"You\\'re pretty close to you\\'re pretty close to your dad\\'s mom.Oh, I\\'m sorry about that.\", \"When did she pass away High School.\", \"Okay, so alright, so make a note of that okay all right so yeah definitely make sure that we talk a little bit about that okay so at 10 mom and dad divorce less than two years your Mamrie Mary\\'s Mary\\'s Bruce so then what happened what happened to you after the divorce Did you were you with your dad with with youokay so then you alright so then Bruce your mom and Bruce in the you because I know you\\'re seeing more time with her moved to what like a different different town differentOkay.\", \"All right.\", \"So prior to moving to a new school, were you in a public school or private schoolswitch or private school?\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.\", \"How was that transition for you going from public school to private school?Okay.\", \"And so then that would have been in around the time when you were 1213 when you made that move.\", \"Okay, so then, sounds like to that that was the time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating.Oh, that you felt when you say pressure from her In what way?\", \"Were she pressuring you?Okay.\", \"Like what say that you would fit in more or okay.\", \"Okay, okay doingAnd it sounds like what you were saying was that we\\'ll ask you how you felt.\", \"And you said you You said you weren\\'t excited.\", \"You weren\\'t excited.\", \"Like I wasn\\'t excited, but so doesn\\'t mean so did that mean that you weren\\'t sounds like if you weren\\'t happy?Okay.\", \"And then what when you would do that what would be the riskOkay.\", \"Well, so many ways, like, one might be putting words your mouth, but what like, kind of get over it or like deal with it or, okay.\", \"So and so then you were feeling pressure from her sounds like also to that you weren\\'t really feeling like that they were really that maybe there wasn\\'t as much concern about your feelings about where you were.\", \"Was there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in terms of like, kind of the Get over it?\", \"You know that?No, you\\'re in terms of the school.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So, that kind of pressure.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And then you said that you didn\\'t really like Bruce, what kind of person was a man?\", \"What was making you not like him so well?Oh, so that maybe that there was something going on between Bruce and your mom prior to the divorce?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Sorry to hear that must have been really hard.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"Like, were you?\", \"I mean, how what was the arrangement where you\\'re spending time with him sometimes and spending time with your mom?Okay.\", \"So then, given the fact that in case you weren\\'t happy in school, you said that it was more kind of an uppity school, private school.\", \"Kids Was it a mixed school or was it like an all girls school?\", \"Yeah, mix school and that kind of clicky sounds like and then your mom really sounds like she really was pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you so that you fit in a little bit better.\", \"So when in this process Did you find yourself like like turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge things likeOkay.\", \"And do you recall the first time that you then vomited or use vomiting as a way to kind of like manage the overeating?So she was really critical of how you looked.\", \"Okay, okay, so then what was that?\", \"What did that do?\", \"Let me take a step back.\", \"So it sounds like that.\", \"You\\'ve always been a little closer to your dad.\", \"So then what was the divorce and the move and some of that transition?\", \"What effect did that have on your relationship with your mom?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So the two of you don\\'t get along as well.\", \"Okay.\", \"Did it was it getting?\", \"Was it kind of the same during that time?\", \"Or was it getting worse?Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"And then she was then coming back more harshly and more critically.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Well, it\\'s not unusual.\", \"I mean, a couple things, certainly not unusual for, you know, girls at that age, you know, in terms of like, kind of the social influence or kind of the social contagion of, you know, with eating and diet, you know, binge eating and dieting and vomiting.\", \"So it sounds like that, that was kind of, in some respects part of that culture.\", \"But it also sounds like that there, you know, in terms of the external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look a particular way.\", \"It almost sounded like that, that she was saying that you were like, What?\", \"You were too heavy for a particular outfit.\", \"And so then, I\\'m sure that that Do you remember how that was feeling to you at that time when she would say things like that?All right cut of Trump.\", \"Did you talk to anybody about that?\", \"Did you talk with your dad about that?\", \"Or?Okay.\", \"So you kept a lot of those feelings to yourself.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay, well, that\\'s that\\'s, that\\'s helpful.\", \"Let\\'s kind of let\\'s kind of hang on to that, because we\\'ve got a couple things because obviously, I think the the divorce the move the transition from middle school to high school.\", \"Also sounds though that also during that time that you\\'re obviously you didn\\'t have a very good relationship with Bruce to begin with.\", \"And that your relationship with your mom was kind of deteriorating.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And then I know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in, in high school, but during that time, like, you know, eighth or ninth grade, did you have more contact with her?\", \"Were you able to, likeokay, okay.\", \"Okay, um,Okay, so then, right?\", \"So not only did Where\\'s your relationship with your mom kind of deteriorating, then all of a sudden, she\\'s pregnant, she delivers.\", \"You have a baby sister.\", \"They\\'re working.\", \"And now not only are you kind of feeling distressed about your relationship with her, but now you\\'re also feeling the pressure to take care of a baby sister.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay, and so, during that time, you\\'re feeling what?okay.\", \"emotional weight on your shoulders.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And then and then what was your eat so then that would have been like, you know, the years like 14 maybe to 16 when you were more active.\", \"involved with that.\", \"What was your eating?\", \"Like during that time?So were you binge eating more during that time then?Okay.\", \"All right, such as throwing up, so vomiting.\", \"Okay, so then that, that kind of began to that started during that particular time.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"That\\'s, yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"That\\'s really helpful to get that.Okay, um, did anybody get anybody like emerges like, like a best friend or a really good friend during that time or?Okay, and what\\'s her name?Julia.\", \"Okay.\", \"So do you enjoy?\", \"Did you enjoy and still kind of maintain contact during the time?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Did Julia know what was going on with you?\", \"Are you Did you ever talk with her about kind of like the stress you were under?So if she was one person that you could kind of confide in a little bit.\", \"Did she know about your the struggles you\\'re having with your ex With your binge eating no likes.All right.\", \"Okay, that\\'s helpful.\", \"So, so Julia was and then kind of a source of support for you during that time.\", \"And also sounds like your grandmother was but then you\\'d also mentioned early on that your grandmother died in high school.\", \"Okay, and so that when did she pass away?\", \"Okay, when you were 16 Okay.\", \"What was that like for you when she died?\", \"Yes.I\\'m sorry about that.And so did you, were you able to eventually go?\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So during that time when you were arguing, you notice more, okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So, okay, that\\'s helpful.Oh, okay, so alright, so thenOkay, so in the middle of your senior year, then your mom and Bruce get divorced.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right, so 17 mom and first divorce.\", \"Okay, what was that time like for you?\", \"Because then obviously then Brooke is then she\\'s about two years old, right?\", \"No, no, no, she before.\", \"Okay, she\\'s four years

know in around the divorce?Okay.\", \"All right.Okay, so it\\'s almost as though that No, she didn\\'t have anybody and she was you felt like that.\", \"She was kind of like trying to reach out to you, like Mike almost like too little too late or, okay.\", \"So then, you know continued sounds like continued kind of like anger and frustration with her.\", \"And then did did you notice any changes in your eating during that time?Okay, I want to thank you for your participation so far in this intake.\", \"But I want to move to another section of intake, specifically your family history

questions that Okay, Have you ever had a suicide attempt?So no attempts I\\'ve ever had thoughts of suicide.that\\'s all you ever do.\", \"But sometimes, yeah, the thought crosses your mind like

how it\\'s structuredAlright, so we\\'ve completed intake.\", \"Also some more questions, but we\\'ll get to the Catholics, the counseling sessions.\", \"Next week, we\\'ll get started working on

week.\", \"Thanks, Rhonda.All right, let\\'s How are you?\", \"It\\'s good to see you.\", \"Yeah.Silence.\", \"Terrific.\", \"So what was what specifically?\", \"I mean, I know we\\'ve talked a lot about that, but what specifically did you say to her, or how did you bring it upright.\", \"Right.\", \"Right.\", \"Because I think that\\'s really similar No, we kind of talked about that.\", \"Because I remember like a few sessions ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems like one of the ways that you\\'ve we talked about that before in terms of like, you know, first starting that oftentimes one of the ways that you manage your feelings that you kind of you think you\\'re letting people know what you\\'re you know, feeling but it doesn\\'t really come out.\", \"And I know that it\\'s something that you and I had to really like you know, kind of work out but sounds like that.\", \"You were able to talk with her in that She heard you.\", \"And as I want, as I kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in a very positive way.It\\'s really nice, I think to you\\'ve been able to do that more with me, and I feel like that, that I feel like it\\'s been really helpful.\", \"I know, they\\'ve been kind of pushing you on that.\", \"And that\\'s been hard, but I feel like it\\'s been really nice to feel like it\\'s really been helpful with your relationship with Kathy.\", \"So that\\'s fantastic.\", \"And also, you know, again, I know that I\\'ve keep, you know, like saying this over and over again.\", \"But you know, as you\\'ve worked on these things, it\\'s been really notable that it\\'s really had a nice positive effect on your eating because it seems like it\\'s really you\\'ve really seen a lot of real nice improvements.\", \"So awesome.\", \"Anything else that you know, so you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything else go on this week?\", \"Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke.okay.\", \"So she\\'s still sixers.\", \"Did she have a birthday recently?Oh, that\\'s great.\", \"almost seven great.\", \"You plans for birthday for her or what are youOkay?\", \"Like anything frozen.\", \"Okay, okay, okay.\", \"Yes.\", \"Okay, that sounds terrific.\", \"And so then you spend some time with her.\", \"So obviously that was real positive for you.\", \"Did you?\", \"When you were there?\", \"Did you have any opportunity to, you know, visit with your mom?\", \"or How did that go?\", \"IHow does it feel for you in terms of like for her?\", \"I know you\\'ve talked about not really liking that.\", \"She all the sudden, is deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life.\", \"But how is it for her to kind of like want to want to know how things have been going for you.\", \"I mean,So kind of what we had discussed kind of that you\\'ve been, you\\'ve like, you\\'ve been allowing yourself to be more connected with her, but you\\'re still kind of keeping up keeping a little bit of a boundary.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Well, I\\'m sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that\\'s gone on, you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it\\'s just, you know, kind of like the wondering about that.\", \"I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on, but then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke, you know, even I still even remember to, for her to have gotten to the point where she wouldn\\'t even let you like go to your grandmother\\'s funeral or at least you know, kind of, so all those things have been so like, you know, front and center, you know, and so now I feel like that she\\'s made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being a mom, that sounds like that.\", \"You\\'re really working to try to manage that in, you know, in a better way?yeah, yeah, but when you do butt heads, what is it how what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of like you feel like that there\\'s a little bit of a friction.Right.\", \"So that really, that\\'s a really stressful time?Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, you know, we\\'ve really reviewed this quite a bit but You know, historically, that\\'s how it\\'s been, you know that that\\'s really been a real enemy.\", \"It really clarifies why we\\'re working on this because it\\'s so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patches, that it really all of a sudden evokes all these like negative feelings.\", \"And that\\'s when food like really, you know,Right.\", \"Right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So it\\'s really hard to, you know, I can understand it\\'s really hard to let that go.\", \"I mean, cuz obviously, there\\'s a lot of lot of feelings that you have about that.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"But on the other hand, too, it seems like that, you know, things have been going really well.\", \"How have things been going in terms of just in general like school friendships, you know, anything else that\\'s on the horizon?\", \"I won\\'t get too excited about that.\", \"But tell me about him telling you about him.Now what\\'s this?\", \"You have to at least give me his name?\", \"What\\'s his name?Alan.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, did you like, I\\'m not gonna blow this out of proportion.\", \"But how?\", \"How did that kind of come about?Yeah.\", \"Nice.\", \"Nice.\", \"That\\'s great.\", \"Oh, I\\'m really happy.\", \"That\\'s great.\", \"So, a lot of really nice things that are going on.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s terrific.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So then for you to go like from, you know, because, you know, we kind of got going with this thing.\", \"It was kind of like, you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes twice a day, and now it\\'d be down to, you know, three, like in the space of like, you know, just like seven eight weeks is pretty remarkable.\", \"So no, I\\'m really pleased with how hard you\\'ve been working cuz you\\'ve really been pushing yourself.\", \"And I really appreciate it.\", \"I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard.\", \"It\\'s hard for youAnd you may not, you know, I mean it\\'s like, you know, another we talked about there\\'s like maybe there are times when you just don\\'t really want to share some of that stuff.\", \"You know, and and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like, you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad.\", \"If you would want to share it, you\\'d want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like, like, Oh, yeah, you were so mean to me now have an eating disorder, you know, because then that that feels, you know, that doesn\\'t feel quite right.\", \"And know that that\\'s, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don\\'t really feel like that.\", \"That\\'s how you\\'d want that to go, you know?\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I know we\\'ve talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad?\", \"Yeah,So nice.\", \"They\\'ll be really nice for you to spend time with them.\", \"That\\'s great.\", \"That\\'s really great.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So let\\'s talk some more about this thing with your mom, because I feel like that.\", \"I mean, I know it\\'s tough, but I guess I\\'ve been thinking about this a lot, especially after last session that that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke are so close, and it does feel like that your mom is, at least she seems like she\\'s making she\\'s trying to make an attempt to connect with you.\", \"Whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel like that you?\", \"Well, what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like, maybe not let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit.\", \"I mean, is there something is there something that like, if you could ask They\\'re like, okay, mom, if you did this, then I would do this.\", \"Not that you would do that.\", \"But just wondering if like, what would you?\", \"ideally what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more.Yeah, I know.\", \"We talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like that you could?\", \"Like, even let her know that.\", \"That that puts a lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings because I know that in the moment you feel it.\", \"But what would it be like for you if you were to just like, yeah, say like, you know, I know that you\\'re I know that you mean Well, I mean, maybe she doesn\\'t, but maybe it\\'s sometimes important to approach it that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you know, I feel like that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way.\", \"And, you know,right, because I know that you did that.\", \"You\\'ve done that with your roommate.\", \"I know there\\'s been other times when people have done that.\", \"So I know that that\\'s been kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you\\'re feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that and you know, thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that every once in a while she kind of like jabs here, she\\'ll send something out and and, and the way that you take it in is more like harsh, critical.\", \"You know her and, and I just don\\'t know like color.\", \"It\\'s kinda like with Kathy.\", \"When you Talk with her how it\\'s like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course, like, you know, uh, you know, I\\'ll try to be more sensitive and I\\'m not really sure.\", \"You know whether or not your mom would be.yeah, yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Well, I think there are times when I wonder if like, maybe if there\\'s a time when you say something, like, I know there have been times when you kind of snap back at her, you know, or you\\'ll kind of like, you know, barber or kind of jabber a little bit.\", \"What if, you know, again, you What have you thought about like, because it sounds like that you\\'re really aware when you do that?\", \"Because you know that when she says something, you have a tendency to jet back.\", \"You could just say, you know, You know, I realized I was I, that was a that was a jab at you.\", \"And I\\'m really sorry, I aware that that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I that doesn\\'t I don\\'t feel very good about that.\", \"Now I wonder how she would you know if, if that would, what that would do, maybe, maybe it wouldn\\'t do anything or may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but you think about it, I mean, and you kind of Mull that over in your mind about what that might be like, because my experience has been that sometimes.\", \"You know, I hate the phrase, be a bigger person, because then you know, I didn\\'t want that to come across that way.\", \"But sometimes in order to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like, kind of be willing to do something just a little different.\", \"And since it seems like you have a growing awareness of, you know, the interactions that you have with her I wonder if that might be worthwhile.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"mulling over and think about it and, and we\\'ll keep talking about it.\", \"But yeah, sounds like it was a really terrific week and been working really hard it really pays off because again, the more you\\'ve done that we\\'ve seen real positive impact on your eating so niceWell, I could see these types of decisions where you\\'re talking about potentially breaking families up and having real consequences to families.\", \"I could see how these decisions could be.\", \"I\\'m sure there\\'s guidelines you are supposed to follow that you really don\\'t have a whole lot of choice in.\", \"But you could also really agonize and overanalyze a decision like that because the consequences are so great.\", \"Maybe somehing that could be happening.Yeah.\", \"Well, and this is really the one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress.\", \"We talked about this insecurity.\", \"You\\'re on this I\\'m sure.\", \"And so you know, one question may be, did you make a efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family but the larger question is, you as a person can you can you do this, this job and if you do it and make money Like, what would you do then?\", \"Could you go through this again?And it could be you certainly in a job where, like, most jobs where mistakes have consequences.\", \"You also do a lot of good for a lot of people.\", \"So by you not being in the field.\", \"They\\'re not getting the benefit of the skills you have.So, so mostly This was good until recently.\", \"Well, alright, let\\'s look at this from another point of view.\", \"You really seem like, you can empathize with these families.\", \"You really, to me, it seems like you really know what they\\'re feeling.and appreciating their perspective.\", \"Take a moment and try to walk in their shoes.\", \"If a professional like yourself came to you and your family situation and maybe you\\'re engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family we\\'ve broken up temporarily.\", \"What would you want?\", \"How would you want them to process that?\", \"Like you said, thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family?\", \"How would you want them to feel that?\", \"Would you want them to process that decision?So from the family\\'s point of view, if you\\'re in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do.\", \"Well, you\\'d like to have some compassion for you.\", \"Okay, that seems reasonable.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So now flip back into the role you\\'re in.\", \"You made the decision you had to make although you\\'re second guessing it That\\'s separate.\", \"Do you have compassion for them?Sarah, how are you doing today?good.\", \"Okay.\", \"I understand you have some symptoms that have been bothering you.About seven or eight

to the symptoms.So you see you kind of play along.All right.\", \"So do you ever have any thoughts related to death or dying or anything like that?You worried about what?So there\\'ll be more proof that the way you\\'ve seen this realAbout that way.\", \"Hmm.\", \"How about any drug or alcohol?\", \"abuse?\", \"Right?Any medical conditions?Has there ever been a time when you felt like really very happy, like how lotta energy it was very happy for several days.That\\'s never happened?Okay.Have you ever heard or seen things other people can\\'t hear or see.who\\'d been hospitalized before?So, I would like to get him to talk to a counselor today.How do you feel about that?I think it would be helpful for you.\", \"We had a counselor talk to you today.You can.\", \"you can be okay with that.you can play along.Sure.\", \"I want to thank you for answering these questions.\", \"I know this is a tough experience for you have a tough time with everything that\\'s going on that you\\'ve described.\", \"So it\\'s, it\\'s been helpful for you to answer these questions for me.\", \"And I just need a couple minutes and I\\'ll get you over to see a counselor and we\\'ll kind of go from there.\", \"thanks, Sherry.Yes, you really get where they\\'re coming from you really understand the suffering bowl.Well, let\\'s, let\\'s talk about that.\", \"So you\\'re in, you\\'re in a position where you have to make some decisions about people\\'s lives.\", \"And sometimes those decisions result in people being separated from the family.\", \"Sometimes they don\\'t.\", \"Are you really the cause?\", \"In the larger picture?\", \"Are you really the cause of these families being broken up?Well, you\\'re the immediate cause kind of at the end of the whole process, but the true cause happened years or months before you got there as people made decisions that maybe weren\\'t the best for their children for themselves.\", \"So you\\'re really coming in, to some extent the tail end of a long series of behavioral choicesUltimately, for this family that\\'s causing you the cycle that you\\'re worried about.\", \"In kind of the looking at the long term lengths, do you think the children are better off?\", \"Because they\\'re not with a family right now?So immediately, there\\'s some pain because you have to pick up the family but the long run.\", \"Maybe there\\'s a better result.\", \"Even with that, though, let\\'s talk about the concern you have about making a poor decision.\", \"So this based on what you\\'re describing, do you believe this was actually a poor decision?Yeah, it feels like it is.\", \"And it was a tough decision.\", \"But looking at it in the weight of the evidence.\", \"Maybe you can appreciate that you might have had to the same thing you if you go back in time.So you really did what you had to do.\", \"Because there\\'s still a pain component there for them.\", \"You\\'re feeling torn.\", \"And you don\\'t want to go through this again?But doing your job in a world where you could make a mistake, that\\'s not as appealing.So in this particular instance, this what you\\'re saying doesn\\'t seem like a mistake.\", \"Let\\'s consider a situation where you did make a mistake.\", \"That would be the worst case, right?\", \"We\\'re just taking things to the worst case scenario.\", \"Okay.\", \"Your fear here is that in a sense, regardless of what already happened, going forward, you\\'d be mortified to make an error.\", \"Because this pain you\\'re feeling right now.\", \"There\\'s just a variable that\\'s thrown everything into chaos for you.\", \"So looking around like where you work and and the history of your profession, what\\'s the mistake you see people make from time to time and you\\'ll be frightened of.And then someone\\'s hurt.\", \"Okay.Should I do it today?You did okay.\", \"I understand you haven\\'t been feeling too great lately.something might be wrong in what way maybe?You\\'re waking up earlier than you want to.So so your mood, your mood, didn\\'t elevate Like, maybe you hoped it would.and realizing, this is what brought in today.more down.All right, so you you mentioned that this is a go to one from high school.\", \"Yeah, sure.\", \"How long would that be?So about eight years and even even feeling down has the sleeping problem for that one.you mentioned the word gloomy.And the low energies been a problem for that long as well.And you\\'ve been waking up earlier than you want.How about you?\", \"Do you mentioned the depressed mood?\", \"You feel down?\", \"Is that worse than a particular time of the day?It was the morning mornings the worst.So I\\'m gonna ask you some other questions related to this.\", \"You mentioned depressed mood.\", \"And you mentioned how you reacted to the wedding.\", \"How it wasn\\'t what you hoped.\", \"Have you lost in In other things that might be fun or pleasurable.as much Okay.Any changes to your appetite or weight?How about feelings of restlessness or the opposite kind of being slowed down?\", \"I know that.Ever feel a sense of worthlessness?like that.\", \"How about concentration?\", \"How\\'s that been?You do okay with that?Do you ever have thoughts of death or dying?Any drug or alcohol use or medical conditions.Have you ever seen or heard things other people cannot see or hear?Have you ever had a time?\", \"You mentioned your mood is gloomy.\", \"Have you ever had a time when your mood was too happy?\", \"Like when you\\'re excessively happy?\", \"A lot of energy?here been hospitalized before.Do you have feelings of hopelessness?And how\\'s your self esteem?Okay.pretty good.All right, Sherry.I\\'d like to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency.\", \"If I just take a couple days to to get you in with somebody is that okay?I appreciate you answering these questions.\", \"For me.\", \"This has been helpful.Carl How you doing today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.Last week you were talking in therapy?So her work slow down, or not being efficient work is affecting your work productivity.you don\\'t always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation.You know, you have an explanation for why that works.So you\\'re feeling stuck with this whole thing?your attempt to fix the problem hasn\\'t really worked the way you want.sort of clear plan.The options are exhausted.And this is frustrating for you.There\\'s no other avenue.\", \"you thought about a letter.But who would you send it to?You don\\'t view them as a potential solution.some other resource you haven\\'t tried yet.They\\'re discussed at this regular meeting.This could be another option for you.So everyone will hear your complaintand maybe react in a way to help you maybe.You feel as though you found an option here?your first Started with all this.It feels better now as you\\'re contemplating and another potential Avenue here.well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up.Move for you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And we\\'ll schedule See you next week.\", \"And we can pick up from there.\", \"Sounds good.\", \"All right.\", \"Cool.\", \"Next car.\", \"Thank you.Hi, Miss Watson, see you again.\", \"See, I\\'m glad you came back in.\", \"I\\'ve got the results now of the blood work that we did after your checkup.\", \"And before we go over any of that I really wanted to find out from you how things are going and what you\\'re concerned about.Is that the first time that\\'s happened?What do you think is goinglet\\'s try to figure some of this out.\", \"Okay.\", \"When you said you were throwing up blubbery, throwing up bright red blood and was it like little spots, big spots?And did did you have any other symptoms?what time of day was this?\", \"throughout the day, throwing up the bloodLook, I can understand why you\\'re worried.\", \"All right, because throwing up Blood is scary, and waking up soaked in sweat in the middle of the night.\", \"That doesn\\'t feel right either.\", \"Let me ask you a couple of questions that might help explain things.\", \"When did you have your last drink?okay, so that was earlier this morning.\", \"All right, what did you have?so tell me how it helps you.So over the course of the day, in order to study yourself in order to feel calmer.\", \"How many drinks do you end up having?singles or doubles?right.\", \"So is it mainly vodkaand you ever get that feeling in the morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling so edgy.\", \"They need a drink to calm down.\", \"Yeah.\", \"It\\'s like the only thing that works for me.\", \"Anything that works, too.\", \"So in the past week, do you think you\\'ve been drinking more?Hasn\\'t been daily.\", \"Oh, yeah.\", \"Right.\", \"So the longest you\\'ve gone without a drink in the last month would be how long?so for all of those things, the alcohol helps.Yeah.\", \"And does it ever happen sort of by the end of the day, that you have trouble the next day remembering what happened?having that.\", \"Have you tried it all to cut down on your drinking?You find yourself feeling feeling guilty about the alcohol.because what I understand from what you\\'re telling me is that the drinking helps meet a certain need for you, in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on, and meets a need in terms of trying to keep you calmer.\", \"But at the same time, it\\'s getting you into trouble.\", \"It\\'s getting into trouble in terms of relationships, but it\\'s also the most likely act explanation for why you\\'ve been throwing up blood isn\\'t why the lab results that I\\'ve got are consistent with an amount of alcohol that\\'s too much for your body to handle.\", \"Really, really, and that means, ideally, that we\\'re going to work together to find a way to do something about it.Jasmine how you doing today?okay.\", \"What\\'s been going on?lot of anger.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Can you give me some examples?So quite a bit of anger.\", \"Right.\", \"So from your perspective, it doesn\\'t seem to make sense why he got so angry.\", \"did anything change around the time that I started?Alright, so you\\'re getting upset you have some angerany other time that you\\'re feeling angryAlright, so that experience for you.\", \"You feel like you\\'re releasing more energy than maybe the other people in the game can waitAlright, so thein recent memory, your anger has increased, but it\\'s still not really clear what\\'s going on.\", \"that\\'s causing the anger.You feel busy, like in your daily life, like a lot of responsibilities?and what kind of things you\\'re doing.see a lot of responsibilities in the home.What type things are you doing?You\\'re doing everything and has always been this way.Okay.\", \"Where you\\'re really just doing everything in the home.I want to ask youCan I ask you or mention a few words?\", \"Right?\", \"I would like you to, if you\\'re okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind like and you can buy say a word, you can offer several responses.\", \"But try not to invest a lot of thought into the response more just what occurs to you.\", \"Oh, but does that make sense?\", \"All right.\", \"So the first word isrepetition.All right.\", \"Let me give you another word, relationship.Let me offer you another wordwork.Good, alright.\", \"How about another word here?\", \"PowerSo do you see anythemes and in the words that you provided backcontrolled and structured?What\\'s the source of that controlling structure?\", \"Is there a source of it?Somebody told me you\\'re thinking,So as you\\'re telling me this and you\\'re explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance What are you feeling?is a similar to the anger that you\\'ve been experiencing recently.\", \"Like at the dry cleaner places.Serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship is what\\'s really causing the anger.So is this is your talk about this do you feel like this is new information you\\'re kind of realizing something that you didn\\'t realize beforeSo you feel this, this kind of big moment in terms of awareness.Okay, so maybe through this session, you develop more insight about what\\'s contributing to the anger.But But this source of anchor, this relationship, you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Where\\'s the other objects of your ad?\", \"If you weren\\'t really sure,All right, chess move.\", \"I feel like we\\'ve made some progress here.\", \"And I\\'d like you to between now and next session, if you\\'re comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what informations may have been revealed to you a little bit.\", \"And we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue.\", \"So that\\'s like a good plan.Well, I appreciate you coming in today, and I\\'ll see you in week.\", \"Okay.\", \"Thank you.Are you doing today?I\\'m doing okay.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"I understand you\\'ve been having some symptoms that have been bothersome to you.Can you tell me about those?You lose it every time you have to make a presentation.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Tell me what would involve losing it.very it\\'s very distressing.\", \"So So tell me about the nature of this meeting that\\'s leading to this.\", \"This anxiety.\", \"So you said it was a you had to make a presentation about the structure of it.or how long do you have to speak?When when in the course of like with this meeting occurring?\", \"When do you start to feel nervous?The day before?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So the day before the meeting, you start to have similar symptoms, different symptoms.\", \"What do you feelpanicking as the meeting starting,So, at the meeting, everybody takes a turn, and does this brief presentation.\", \"And tell me what\\'s happening as with your, your feelings as they\\'re moving around.\", \"It\\'s like if you sit at a table or Yes, as they\\'re moving around the table and then coming closer to you.They\\'re gonna notice you.there\\'s too much anxiety.Yeah.\", \"So, so you would push that door open, they would all be looking at you.\", \"They would wonder why you left.\", \"So you just wrote out the meeting somewhere else.\", \"And did anybody notice after?This is this is frustrating for you.Have there been times where you\\'ve fled the room?\", \"And then since then you haven\\'t.Something about that intense interaction changed how you\\'re feeling distracted you something like that.So from from that meeting on like till now, have you been able to stay in for eight other meetings?\", \"No.\", \"She had to leave because of the intensity of the symptoms.\", \"Yeah, and you\\'re having you\\'re experiencing symptoms.\", \"When you go Avoid that interaction the room to right because you don\\'t feel good about letting them down orSo it\\'s this meeting, really, you\\'re in your situation where if you go and attend the meeting, you\\'re going to end up leaving it because of the anxiety.\", \"If you don\\'t attend it, Have these concerns about the performance in your shops?\", \"You\\'re kind of stuck.\", \"You\\'re kind of stuck, right?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Any other symptoms that you think may or may not be related to this intense anxiety?\", \"have any effect onAny sadness or anything like that?Throw it down.Sasha, I know it\\'s been tough going through all this and the symptoms have been tough for you.\", \"We\\'ll get you scheduled in here to get treated a couple days.\", \"We\\'ll get you in a couple days.\", \"And you can start working with a counselor to address these symptoms.\", \"I appreciate you spending this time with me it was helpful to get a better understanding of what you\\'re going through.\", \"Thanks.hi you how to do it today.I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"So

brush in, he\\'d mentioned some shopping and that\\'s one of the things he was certain about.You remember how much you spentDude, I feel like you spent more than you usually would spend a trip to the mall.So have you ever had a time in the past when you felt this way where you felt really good?Life\\'s fall into place.\", \"So you\\'re feeling pretty good.\", \"You feel like things are On your

did you end up hospital or being treated some other way?\", \"Just no treatment?But you believe you were depressed?Now we\\'re back then.\", \"Did you see or hear things that other people couldn\\'t see or hear?not now.\", \"We\\'re back then.Okay.All right, Sherry.\", \"answering these questions has been helpful to me.\", \"I appreciate it.\", \"I\\'m going to get you over to see a counselor.\", \"Just a few moments.\", \"I know that you\\'re feeling pretty good, but I\\'d like them to talk to you for just a bit.\", \"Okay, thanks forcorleto how you doing today?I do well, thanks for asking.\", \"How\\'d you do this week?postponed gratification.\", \"Yeah,so it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana.\", \"At least in most cases.\", \"It was rough.So it was it was difficult for you, but most cases, you\\'re able to pull off the 10 minutes.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"That sounds like there\\'s a few instances where you\\'re able to hold it off longer because something else kind of Yeah, came up.so another activity presented itself and You\\'ve forgotten with marijuana.So have your feelings about marijuana change since we last talked?Tell me about that.So you still you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana?But at the same time, you want to go back to work.\", \"And if I remember, right, you\\'re the person that you could go work for.\", \"I guess you know them right.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s my uncle, your uncle, and you need to be cleaned for was about two months.Soyou have kind of opposing forces here, right?\", \"You have your enjoyment of marijuana.\", \"And then you, you know, that\\'s something you like you don\\'t wanna give up.\", \"And you believe you have a right to do that.\", \"But then there\\'s that job.So it doesn\\'t seem fair to you.\", \"But she recognizes the reality of your situation.So it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment.So you\\'re not happy about that choice.And kind of what we did with the postpone gratification was just really just ask you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that.\", \"And more, although it\\'s difficult, It\\'s difficult for you.SoI asked you to track the number of times you smoke marijuana.\", \"Did you really track that over the last week?Yeah, you remember how many times that was?between 15 and 20.\", \"And how many times did something kind of get in the way that\\'s something else come up in that 10 minutes span that distracted you or that you enjoyedSo you can see in that 10 minutes, things can happen.\", \"Right things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana.\", \"Sometimes nothing does and after 10 minutes, use it.\", \"And sometimes something does kind of get in the way with a marijuana like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you didn\\'t use.So with that in mindyou found the experience rough, but was it tolerable?\", \"was a bit Do you think for this next week?\", \"We could try postpone gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes?that that is definitely.\", \"That is a longer time.\", \"Yeah.no compromises.\", \"15 Okay, do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15?\", \"All right, so let\\'s go with 15 minutes, right.\", \"So 15 minutes, you know, as compared to 10.\", \"I\\'ll give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you.\", \"And you wouldn\\'t use that instance, right.\", \"There\\'s also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives like like you mentioned walking right.\", \"You could use that time and start walking.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Anything else that that you like, maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana, but she didn\\'t have anything available?\", \"What would you do instead?or should it be okay, well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer you\\'re delaying using marijuana, you could start watching the show.At the under 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show.\", \"So do you see kind of how it works?\", \"Like is it making sense to you the postponing?And maybe if we\\'re successful to 15?Who knows?\", \"We\\'ll move it up from there.how it goes the 15?\", \"Yeah, I\\'ll see how that goes.\", \"You know, I\\'m hoping.\", \"And I hope this kind of makes sense that there\\'ll be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that use marijuana.\", \"Like because you\\'re giving yourself that many more opportunities, the longer you wait.\", \"Right.\", \"The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way so to speak.\", \"And probably what you\\'ll see, just like you saw this last because you\\'re, you know, you used marijuana less frequently, just by waiting the 10 minutes.\", \"Even though you described as difficult I\\'m sure it was, but there were a few times where it kind of worked outSo, I think that planning something for that time would be helpful.\", \"And try to plan something 15 minutes, even if you fully intend to beyond the 15 to go right and use, I think it\\'s still useful plan something in there.\", \"You never know that might take you.\", \"Or you might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use.\", \"Okay.\", \"So that\\'s like a plan.Sounds like a plan?All right.\", \"We\\'ll go with that.\", \"And I\\'ll see you next week.\", \"Okay,

how much should you drink in total?But How long had it been since you had a drink?\", \"before that?three weeks or so.\", \"She did really well.\", \"And then you had you had one drink.\", \"And that just made you feel like you weren\\'t successful.And you feel that kind of led to drinking some more.\", \"So you had a rough time with things?what nowis that where you were when that first strike?\", \"was out with friends?So there\\'s a few things going on.We\\'ve talked in the past, right about separating the behavior from the person.\", \"Right?\", \"So, behavior is what we do, not who we are.\", \"You remember those discussions?\", \"And correct me if I\\'m wrong with sounds like I\\'m using different words than you use.\", \"But it sounds like when you had that first drink, you\\'re kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working.That\\'s pretty accurate.\", \"All right.\", \"So taking yourself kind of back to that moment.\", \"All right, we we had that first.\", \"That first drink like you finished that first drankWhat was your What was your thought at that at that moment?Okay, so shameful is kind of like the feeling.\", \"But the thought is I did really, really well.\", \"Right?\", \"So that\\'s what your thinking was.\", \"I did really, really well.And what?\", \"was that the end of the thought, or was that was there more before you had that next trick?sort of sequence would have been you had to drink.\", \"You felt shameful.\", \"At the same time you\\'re thinking that you were doing really well.\", \"And then just really, as you said before, you just felt like a loser.\", \"And then you decided, might as well just have the second drink.\", \"So another thought might be that, like, I might just have a second drink.yeah.\", \"So you can see others some thoughts and some feelings at work.\", \"right as you finish that first drink was a fairly quick, but those thoughts feelings fairly.\", \"occur fairly quickly after the drink.so right away, you regret it and that regret As you thought about it,don\\'t might as well just just continue drinking now, because you kind of blew it.Okay.And that\\'s a common cycle to fall into.\", \"And you had three weeks, we hadn\\'t had a drink prior to that.\", \"So let\\'s, let\\'s look at this.\", \"Let\\'s try to separate the behavior from the self a little bit.\", \"If you had if you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, you had a history of using alcohol and then at three weeks, without any alcohol use, and then their behavior was to have a drink.\", \"What would you think of them?I had a rough day one drink, and what would you think of their behavior?\", \"How would you categorize that behavior?So not ideal,depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible.irresponsible, but you wouldn\\'t necessarily characterize them as a bad person.\", \"But their behavior was a bit of responsible.You know, in terms of like the recovery plan, which would be to not drink.But when you apply that same example examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink?So you see how you\\'re you\\'re being a little bit quite a bit rougher on yourself.\", \"Like your your evaluation of yourself is, is fairly harsh.\", \"You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed.Whereas you wouldn\\'t necessarily evaluate someone else that way.\", \"How would you evaluate your behavior?\", \"How would you How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink?So, so bad, irresponsible, shameful.Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of in terms of your thinking, the way you evaluate it from yourself, like are you into behavior?together a meshed or can you be separated?in that moment.\", \"It\\'s very congruent for you.the shame matches the behavior to behavior matches shame.\", \"Like it\\'s there one at that moment.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"But really, logically, rationally, you\\'re you, Ryan, your identity and values and your behavior, something you do.But in the moment, it\\'s hard for you to see that.Mm hmm.\", \"Looking back on it now is are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are?no, certainly not.\", \"And you were, you were clean for three weeks, and you had one drink.\", \"So really, your behavior was a slip.Right It was and irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose.\", \"But still a slip.\", \"And you could have stopped.\", \"But that shame got ahold of you.\", \"Right.\", \"I thought, well, now I\\'ve done it.\", \"I blew it.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more.\", \"So, I think this is important because we\\'ve seen this cycle like where you have weeks of sobriety, and then we\\'ll drink a bit and then have weeks as writing.\", \"And I\\'m wondering if part of the difficulty you\\'re facing is you\\'re not coping with the slips as just slipsYou\\'re allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than the slip.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"That That\\'s pretty accurate.And you see how the shameful feelings kind of just interfere with the behavior that you really want that\\'s really consistent with their goals, which would be to not continue drinking.\", \"Another piece of this too is the association associating with friends who drink, you\\'re putting yourself in a treacherous situation.\", \"Again, that\\'s a behavior.Right?\", \"That doesn\\'t make you one way or the other.\", \"It\\'s a behavior.\", \"How would you judge that behavior going out with friends?risky, okay.\", \"It\\'s a risky behavior.\", \"And what does it make you Who are you?\", \"Because you do that behavior.\", \"Like how do you feel about yourself?\", \"When you take that risky, behavior, okaySo you have guilt when you go out with your friends.\", \"And then you have shame if you drink.\", \"And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking.\", \"So part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that\\'s a risky behavior, which you have.\", \"And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away, right.\", \"Does that does that separation of what we do and who we are?\", \"makes sense to rationally?feels a little unnatural, though.So maybe, as you\\'re confrontingsimilar situations in the course of the next week, You could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk, and try to try to separate your identity from that behavior.\", \"So, so just judge the behavior.\", \"Okay.\", \"Right.\", \"And don\\'t don\\'t pass any judgment on yourself.So that makes sense.It might help you to.Since it\\'s a little tough to because right now, the feeling and the judgment, retro twined.\", \"Right.\", \"It might help to write down when these things happen, and kind of write down like, like one row for this is how I judge this behavior.\", \"But I\\'m thinking about doing and this is how I judge myself.\", \"So if you see a lot of self judgment, that might be a clue that you\\'re falling into a cycle a little bit,where you\\'re making decisions based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment and behavior.that helped a little bit.So that\\'ll be our plan going forward.\", \"Until next week is note document your judgment about your behavior, any judgment you may have about yourself.\", \"Right, and there\\'s some insight that can be gained there.\", \"Right.\", \"Kind of distinguish the two and making those and try to use that evidence before making a decision to might put you in a risky spot.\", \"Sound like plan?Okay, good.\", \"I\\'ll see you next week.\", \"And we\\'ll see how you did with those goals.So let\\'s say you go into a house, you go to the community, okay?\", \"You go into a house and have an off day.\", \"Maybe worried about making mistakes, maybe stressed about that.\", \"Maybe tired.\", \"And there\\'s some evidence there that you should be able to pick up but you just you don\\'t write somebody lies to you about what the conditions there are You kind of realize that they might not be telling the truth, but you\\'re you\\'re ready to get home.\", \"So you leave and then somebody hurt when you have a worst case.\", \"That\\'s the type of mistake you\\'re afraid of making.\", \"What would that feel like to make that mistake?So that would be a worst case outcome.\", \"You would be extremely upset.\", \"You\\'re extremely upset now.\", \"While you\\'re five out of 10 right now, but you\\'re an eight when you\\'re in bed in the morning.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake like that?\", \"This is the mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught.\", \"Is it reasonable?\", \"They continue on in the field and try to learn from that.Right, there might be consequences for that type of error.\", \"It\\'s not intentional, something that like many mistakes would happen due to conflict confluence of circumstances who being tired of being the end of the day, not being honest.\", \"There\\'s mitigation there.\", \"But still, I can appreciate you would want to make that mistake either way.\", \"What would your after making a mistake like that?\", \"What would your thought be?\", \"Would you be thinking?To my extension, I\\'ll never feel okay about what I did.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought?What do you think would do to your performance?So in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you\\'re having now that result in anxiety, are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake.Right, so one of the thoughts you\\'re having now is you can\\'t make a mistake because it would be too devastating.\", \"And that titles like this.\", \"I have a thought you\\'re having.\", \"So it\\'s like you can\\'t make a mistake.\", \"And this is leaving you emotionally less prepared and probably increased risk of making a mistake.Hi you how to do it today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.So you\\'re doing great.I know your brother brought you in today and he had expressed some concerns about your mood.\", \"Do you know what that\\'s about?Alright, so you feel like, everything\\'s kind of going your way.\", \"Hmm.\", \"And you\\'re really excited about the new business idea.\", \"I know that your brother was a little concerned with how much you\\'ve been spending on the business idea.\", \"And he mentioned some things about different relationships you\\'ve had that are new.\", \"He\\'s worried that you don\\'t want to think this was the new relationship you don\\'t know the guy too wellSo your brother just doesn\\'t.\", \"In your mind, he just doesn\\'t get it.Have you noticed through all this, any change in sleep patterns?\", \"Notice you do feel rested.\", \"You haven\\'t been sleeping as much.And you clearly seem like you\\'re in a good mood No, no sadness right now at that,should be doing pretty well that way.\", \"Have you ever been down or depressed?Do you ever feel this way before?\", \"kind of in a really good, No.\", \"Nothing like this.What do you think about all this one?it\\'s kind of realizing that it\\'s kind of changed my lifeAll right, and you mentioned before that you got some trouble at workright?\", \"How bad that turned outshouldn\\'t have to worry about that.Any medical conditions, you know, have a drug and alcohol you\\'re saving is anything like that?\", \"Are you seeing or hearing anything that other people can\\'t see or hear?no like that?\", \"Sure.\", \"So I know that you\\'re feeling pretty well.\", \"But I would like you to see a counselor, maybe help you as you contemplate these different things we\\'ve been talking about.\", \"If you\\'d be if you\\'d be okay with talking to a counselor,You\\'d be okay with that.\", \"I\\'ll get that set up.\", \"We\\'ll just take a moment.\", \"And I want to thank you for answering my questions.\", \"This has been helpful.Except that when you\\'re in work you worry a lot about how you come across in social situations.Yeah, you said that you worry that you visibly shake.And are there any other things that you worry that people will notice?So it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you\\'re in these social situations.\", \"Yeah.\", \"You say you go read you shake.\", \"Is there anything else that you think that you do?\", \"I mean, describe yourself.\", \"How do you think you look, when you\\'re in these situations, justAnd is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage these problems?So you focus on something you grip onto that Camera.\", \"Do you make eye contact with people?Okay, so you also avoid eye contact?\", \"Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating For example, OkayWhat do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things?\", \"If you stopped gripping onto the camera?\", \"Or, you know, you start to make eye contact and not looking down?\", \"And what do you think would happen?And what I\\'m thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things?\", \"If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work, okay?\", \"And if we did this maybe twice and the first time, you do all the things that you normally do, okay and grip onto something, look down.\", \"And is there anything else that you do when you\\'re in these situations, these work conversations to try and cope.Okay, so in the first time, I want you to do those things as much as you normally would, in fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would.\", \"and then the second time, I want you to drop doing those things all together.\", \"does that sound okay?And do you?\", \"How would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like?Do you have a camera with you that we can video on?Yeah, yeah, we\\'ll use that in just a sec.\", \"before we do this, then we\\'re just going to fill out this form is because what we\\'re doing now is an experiment.\", \"We call it behavioral experiments, see what happens when you change the way that you\\'re behaving?\", \"so the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have, so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work, and who should I play if you\\'re playing yourself in this roleplay?\", \"Who should I be?Okay, so would it work if I was maybe having a wedding and I was hiring?\", \"wedding photographer?What kind of problems do you see coming up in this conversation that we have like what we see yourself doing on cameravisibly shaking.\", \"So how, how much will you be shaking if 100 is like shaking uncontrollably and zero is not shaking at all?\", \"How visibly shaking Will you be?Okay.\", \"So what was the other thing that you just said?Okay, so go read.And how read will you go?\", \"I mean, if we look around this room Okay, thanks.\", \"Hello.\", \"Yeah, you\\'re going to be as kind of brightly pink as these chairs.\", \"Oh, yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"So out of 100 then how how pink would you say these chairs areWhat else you worried is going to happen when we have these conversations, justOkay, and how stupid out of 100 100 is ridiculously stupid.wow, see worried will happen when you have this conversation.\", \"What else might you see on the camera?\", \"And how much will you be sweating?I really think like visibly sweating down the face.\", \"Yeah.Okay, and what you think will happen the second time around when you stop kind of doing the things you normally do to cope when you maybe start to make eye contact.\", \"You\\'re not gripping on something.\", \"How much worse?\", \"slightly worse, like twice as bad?\", \"Okay,right.\", \"Can you give me your phone number?\", \"And yeah, yeah, it\\'s probably best.\", \"Okay.okay.\", \"SoI was just wondering if I could talk to you about maybe doing my weddingI suppose I like lots of shots of our family and our friends quite a lot of natural shots.\", \"You know, talking when they\\'re having drinks.\", \"AndYeah, shots there\\'s going to be a summer wedding.\", \"So we like I like a lot of outdoors shots and if possible, you know, if it\\'s not raining, that would be quite nice and Yeah, quite some arty ones if that\\'s possible.So, have you got anything that you could show me about your past work?\", \"Okay, great.\", \"All right, let\\'s do the second one now.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay, you put down the bottle and make eye contact.\", \"Okay.Hi.\", \"So I was just wondering if I could speak to you about doing my wedding photography.and I\\'d like kind of lots of shots of family and friends and quite a lot of natural shots, you know,Yeah, cuz it\\'s gonna be a summer wedding and Okay, you know, weather dependent.\", \"Of course.\", \"Yeah, it would be really great if we could kind of get lots of shots you know, outdoors.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah, people chatting and maybe some quite arty ones as well.Have you got anything that you could show me about your past work?Let\\'s pause it there.\", \"Okay.\", \"Ryan\\'s gonna give you this back now to look up.\", \"Okay.\", \"And I just want you to watch that.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then we\\'ll chat about it in a moment.\", \"Okay.So, if we just go back to the things that you predicted, then you said that you thought you were going to shake visibly shake.\", \"Could you see yourself shaking on a videoSo you said that you were going to shake 90 out of 100?\", \"How much shaking Would you say that you saw there?Okay.\", \"And you said that you were going to go red, or pink as pink as these chairs?\", \"90 out of 100.\", \"Did you notice yourself going pink?Okay, you said that you were worried that you were going to say something stupid, you know, at 90 out of 100 Did you know yourself say anything stupid?actually it was.\", \"So you thought you were going to be like 90 say something that was 90% stupid.\", \"That\\'s really quite strong.\", \"I mean, in the end did you pick up in Anything that could be maybe put that as a zero?And you said that you thought you were going to be sweating?\", \"Yeah.\", \"And that you\\'re going to be visibly sweating.\", \"Did you?\", \"Did you notice yourself sweating in the end?thought again, you thought you were going to be like night out, like seriously visibly sweating.\", \"So what what score would you actually give it in the end?Mm hmm.\", \"You also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stop choosing your you know your normal strategies.What did you notice watching that video?okay that\\'s all for now.\", \"Thank you so much for your

it\\'s your time to talk or before or after that, and nowsays around 10 people at the meeting.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And and as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end.\", \"So can you describe what\\'s happening say for the beginning of the meeting, in terms of what you\\'re experiencing?And I focused focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you\\'re not really hearing what they\\'re saying.they\\'re saying, all right.\", \"So go on.\", \"So So these you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness, what happens and So, so in the moment when

outline?What happens when you have read the last read last point?Alright, so then the nervousness that\\'s stronger feeling of nervousness that goes away, is replaced by a more general feeling.\", \"nervousness about how your how your boss will think of you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Because of the presentation quality.\", \"Because as you\\'re presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he\\'s picking up on that.\", \"And you\\'re aware of that.\", \"How How long have you noticed?\", \"This, these symptoms that appear in this way.The last few weeks is when you notice that we had we had some nervousness before presenting in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal generally impair your ability to present an effect your grades or anything right.Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what\\'s going on?So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe, maybe she has that going on to the same, same set of

do go.\", \"So when you\\'re down there, or wherever you go in the trip, you\\'re feeling better, like you\\'re enjoying yourself.\", \"But you\\'re also worried at the same time.And the rest of the

if you don\\'t tell them goodbye enough time.Oh, it sounds like maybe if you don\\'t say if you don\\'t say goodbye enough times and settled that, that you\\'ll feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it so that so that\\'s the focal point of this thing\\'s night in some way.\", \"Right?And the way you start to let go is when you tell themSo So what do you find yourself doing?\",

you didn\\'t say goodbye well enough.The property was the property of saying goodbye.\", \"This you feel like you\\'re not doing well enough.So the act of leaving itself Leave shoot guilty.\", \"And what are you guilty of?So abandonfor a short time neglecting them for a short time.And now you\\'re in more of a caregiver role than you were then.So to be the responsible one, there needs to be guilt when you leave, I guessSo there\\'s not another person driving the skill towards you.\", \"That\\'s me.\", \"Just coming in from the side.So if I, if I leave, well, I\\'m responsible.\", \"And if I leave, something bad will happen.\", \"And that\\'ll be on me.So fear of being caught as irresponsible.And you could be a few left to just take you a day\\'s travel or whatever, however far away.\", \"Right.\", \"So yeah, but that\\'s that\\'s still doesn\\'t help relieve anxiety now when you come back, because Have you ever taken a trip that was like withinSo the closer you are, it helps a little bit, it sounds like a good part of the anxiety is still there.\", \"So it really doesn\\'t matter where you go.\", \"It\\'s the fact that you\\'re not home.\", \"The fact that you\\'re not able to fully be responsible in the way that you view it.So at 20 that\\'s a long shift.\", \"So a 20 hour shift.\", \"At what point do you become anxious when did when you start to notice those thoughts?Right So if you\\'re busy at work, the same reality exists, meaning your pets are alone.\", \"But the way you\\'re responding to it is different.\", \"Yeah, you\\'re less anxious.Well, I\\'m buddy let\\'s say not at work, let\\'s say when you\\'re on the vacations in those days in the middle when you\\'re enjoying yourself.\", \"Is that a distraction like the more you enjoy yourself the last yearBut the same reality exists there alone.\", \"So really, it\\'s your way ofwhich way of viewing things that\\'s leading to anxiety.\", \"It\\'s not necessarily what\\'s actually happening.your perception of what\\'s happening.\", \"What could happen.\", \"I guess in this case, not so much what is happening is what you worried.\", \"could could because nothing\\'s happened yet.So, how many?\", \"Well, there\\'s I guess there\\'s a few different.\", \"There\\'s a few different issues here.\", \"Right?\", \"How many vacations you take a year.sort of small proportion of the time so just looking in terms of probabilities you risk is very low because you\\'re not quite that much.\", \"But the other issue is that even at work you\\'re still having the same feelings and even for short trips you\\'re still have the same feelings.\", \"So you\\'re really limiting things xietymuch of the timeit\\'s been this way for yearsSo you\\'re functioning?Approved.\", \"Yeah, he\\'s actually pretty good.\", \"working a lot sounds likeBecause this uncomfortable anxiety.\", \"This is painful for you.going on vacation.\", \"Alright, so let\\'s sayDo you feel less anxious when you With those prevention, okay, so that helps.\", \"Right?\", \"So physically preparing your house so that your pets are safer that helps you.\", \"So what else is going through your mind so you do that right you take all the precautions you can to keep them safe and prepare your dinner for work and everything.\", \"So what\\'s the next thought?So every time when you felt anxious and you wanted to check on them, but you couldn\\'t leave happens then terms of thinking and feeling?Well, just so it doesn\\'t change your function, but society has their anxiety associated withAlright, so depending on what you\\'re thinking about, that can change the level of anxiety you\\'re experiencing.Okay, so there\\'s that is the that is the thought you\\'re having something like thatI still have that you have that thought like,So you can see the power of thinking and all this right.\", \"So the reality of your cat\\'s health and well being hasn\\'t changed the way you view it, as change the way you think about it.\", \"So we talked about before this idea of the adaptive response, right?\", \"So the thoughts you\\'re having now that lead to the anxiety, we believe could lead to anxiety.\", \"They\\'re automatic, right?\", \"They\\'re just popping in your head.\", \"Right?\", \"It\\'s triggered by certain things, like getting ready to leave for work and, and being at work while and look at the time and realizing something.\", \"We have the cats, right.\", \"But that\\'s an automatic that just comes without, like, you can\\'t necessarily stop right?Then the anxiety is right there.\", \"So the adaptive response, we also call self talk.\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s a thought that you can give that you can create consciously.\", \"Right?\", \"You can think to yourself, so it\\'s not automatic.\", \"It\\'s not an adjustment of an automatic thought.\", \"It\\'s a thought that you can deliberately think Almost like repeating a sentence that you\\'ve memorized, you can at will choose to do that.\", \"That makes sense.\", \"So I want to make sure I draw the distinction.\", \"Some thoughts just pop in.\", \"Other thoughts you deliberately, like, when we found is if you have a thought that you deliberately think we call the adaptive response.\", \"It can counter the feelings caused by the automatic thoughts, essentially.\", \"You\\'re just spinning your thoughts.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So, you know, and I want you to work with me to develop these adaptive responses.\", \"I want you to have most of the site all the sites you want and because I think that you can develop ones that are useful to you, but just to give an example when you haven\\'t thought that You know, the older cat can be sick, right?\", \"And adaptive response could be or could be wide, wide variety of thoughts, but one could be it\\'s not likely.\", \"Right?\", \"Like, you know, or if it is likely that you know, he\\'ll probably be okay.\", \"If it\\'s a he or she, okay?\", \"He\\'ll probably be okay till I get home.\", \"Another adaptive response could be it would be sad and unfortunate something happened.\", \"But I have my work responsibilities and at some point I have to leave the cats alone.So you\\'re actively responding.Well, I think that\\'s a productive, adaptive response.\", \"I mean, you know, you\\'re right.\", \"If you don\\'t, if you don\\'t earn income, then they\\'ll have worse problems.\", \"So really good working.\", \"You\\'re, you\\'re being more of service to them and protecting them more soSo that might be one adaptive response you may want to consider applying when you have this, this feeling of anxietySo they\\'re not striking you as anxious when you get home.She continues to survive, despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving.\", \"So that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring a mild stressor.\", \"But sometimes they\\'re asleep when you get home.\", \"So how bad could it be for them?yeah, I mean, their level awareness clearly different than than yours.\", \"Right.\", \"So yeah, I mean, that\\'s another good adaptive response that, you know, much higher level awareness, whereas you\\'re not sure that Have any awareness that you\\'re experiencing anxiety?\", \"Or maybe a little bit with a one cat who runs or think they do?\", \"absolutely.\", \"So it\\'s understandable that you would be anxious and have concerns and but it also seems like you did make preparations to elevate their chances of having a successful experience right being okay.So you implement behaviors that are practical and that I\\'ve worked in making the house safe and keeping the plants away from them and so I think one route here if you\\'re okay with it would be to use work as like the first point I know you have the trip.\", \"I know that\\'s, that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst But you have more chances?\", \"Well, one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because it\\'s more or less a daily thing, right?\", \"five days a week, or whatever it is.\", \"So some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together, right?\", \"You could apply those.\", \"And you know, think about that the responses are not always short.\", \"Right?\", \"The automatic thoughts could be short.\", \"It can even be images, do not necessarily even complete sentences, right?\", \"Like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation.\", \"So it\\'s not necessarily spelled out in English, like a sentence, but adaptive responses.\", \"Well, they could be images too, but the ones I\\'m talking about are really sentences that you\\'re repeating back consciously to yourself.\", \"So it\\'s important to have them prepared and ready to go.\", \"So I often ask clients To kind of write them out and have them available.\", \"So that when that thought comes about, and it seems like you\\'re pretty good at identifying, you know, what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you\\'ve memorized initially you\\'d read the automatic thought I mean, the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought.\", \"Okay, might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and I found that it changes how often and how intense to aback thoughts come in.\", \"Conscious thinking, adaptive responding, does that make sense?you\\'ve already adapted Yeah, you\\'ve already used cognitive behavioral techniques, in a way to reduce anxiety.\", \"So what we\\'re really doing is just expanding and formalizing what you\\'ve already been doing to achieve some success.So, if you could, between now and next session, write down some of the adaptive responses that we discussed the ones you\\'ve already used and, and then work to identify the automatic thoughts at work, and then come up, work to identify them, and then consciously repeat those, those that the responses back when you have those thoughts, okay, so you\\'re really repairing self talk, adaptive responses, with the automatic thoughts, that thought comes right?\", \"And then you have the adaptive response.\", \"And you\\'re repeating it, you know, it\\'s an internal, you\\'re pitting and just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud, although, that would surely be okay to not know, your coworkers, you know, respond something like that.Yeah.\", \"And and putting in a security type measure.\", \"You could lessen anxiety, or it could create anxiety,and I don\\'t know which, you know.\", \"So I think if you\\'re okay with it, we\\'ll start with the adaptive responses.\", \"See how that works out.\", \"And we have other options.\", \"Putting security systems in such to shy out in the future if necessary.\", \"Let\\'s try the adaptive responding.\", \"Then trying to keep track of how well it works for you like, what your what your thoughts and feelings were.\", \"After you applied it,Yeah.\", \"So you know, maybe like a one to 10 with 10 being the worst, okay, and measure it when you first had that experience of it.\", \"I\\'m pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately, you\\'ve experienced it for a long time.\", \"You suffer with it for a long time.\", \"And then after applying the adapter response, especially after a few minutes, applying a few times, maybe shoot for ones, see what it is that and note that, again, the beginning of might not see much of a change at all.\", \"Right?\", \"So be persistent with it.\", \"Okay.\", \"Give it a chance to work and see how it does.\", \"Okay.\", \"We\\'ll start there and we\\'ll kind of review how you do that.\", \"And then we\\'ll work toward the things Analyze the bigger stressor right?\", \"And we\\'ll see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that.\", \"Okay.\", \"So a good plan.\", \"Yes.Would you prefer Miss Bellamy or Pat\\'s fine, great.\", \"Well, it\\'s nice to meet you, Miss mom.\", \"Can you tell me why you\\'re here today?looks really bad.\", \"Um, is there anything else besides your headache that you want to address here today at the clinic?\", \"Was there anything?\", \"Because what we can do is while we\\'re talking and doing your history and physical, I will have my office Secretary look into it the insurance plan that you have.\", \"All right, so you don\\'t have to worry about that.\", \"That\\'s good.\", \"Um, is there anything else?So what I\\'d like to do today and is let\\'s let\\'s take a look at what\\'s causing your headache.\", \"I will go over history fiscal, and then we\\'ll do our Ghana physical exam.\", \"And then we will look into your insurance policy and make sure that\\'s all taken care of that sounds like a good plan.\", \"So that\\'sCan you tell me anything that makes it better?Is there anything that makes it worse?So if you had to rate on a pain scale, zero being no pain 10 being the worst pain you\\'ve ever had to 10yeah, that sounds really bad.\", \"Now as far as radiation doesn\\'t move, doesn\\'t that you said the head.\", \"The pain is all up front.\", \"He is kind of all over.\", \"Okay?as far as in the in the timing you said that started three days ago music uses constant yeahso do you what I want to get is your perception of what you think is going on.I can understand your concern.So it sounds like it\\'s really impacting your life.\", \"If it\\'s okay, I would like to go some talk about a little bit about your medical history and your social history.\", \"All right.\", \"Can you tell me as far as your medical history have you have any medical conditions I should be aware of.Okay.\", \"Any surgical history?Any hospitalizations?All right.\", \"In You said your own medicine you\\'re taking was telling all my training.And they didn\\'t help you?\", \"Okay.\", \"Just wanted to verify.\", \"Given a drug allergies, Okay.\", \"What about family history?\", \"Do you have any medical history of headaches or in my family right now?All right.\", \"I\\'m sorry.\", \"I would like to ask you some social history questions that just for the record.\", \"Records.\", \"Do you smoke?Okay.\", \"Is it cigarettes or?Okay.\", \"And how much do you drink?Okay.\", \"Um, also, Are you married?\", \"Okay.\", \"And children?Okay.\", \"And just some, some just some additional questions is looking at your kind of GYN history.\", \"Are you last menstrual period?\", \"So going back into the history again, have you You said your mom had migraines earlier on.\", \"Have you been around and no other you haven\\'t been nauseous or have you been?OkaySo let me just summarize to make sure I\\'ve got everything straight so far is started an onset of a severe headache about three days ago.\", \"It\\'s worse with movement and light really makes it hurt bad.\", \"It\\'s a 10 out of 10 pain and you\\'re also complaining of a stiff neck with that?.\", \"It came on gradually and it\\'s been constant pain in the frontal area.\", \"medical history you\\'re on hyper you have high blood pressure, but that\\'s controlled with diet.\", \"No surgical history.\", \"No really has The pain though isn\\'t really impacting your day to day living daily life.\", \"You tried to Tylenol, Motrin, it didn\\'t help otherwise no medications.\", \"You\\'ve got the family history of your mom with migraines.\", \"Otherwise your family is healthy.\", \"Yeah.\", \"You smoke about a half a pack a day.\", \"Do don\\'t drink.\", \"And then you were you said you took a trip about a week ago?\", \"Two weeks ago?Okay.All right.OkayHi, Hazel Hey doing today.Okay.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I know when we met last time for your intake.\", \"You were concerned about some presentations that you had to give at school.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And you want to talk about that today?Alright, so was there a time for like, recently when you had to give presentations?How would you consider those?So this presentation you gave with that received a poor score, maybe it was just an isolated incident.But that experience has still led to a lot of things anxiety with subsequent presentations,All right.\", \"So, would it be okay if we kind of step through the whole process of giving a presentationJust before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety?\", \"Like right now or other times are really just in that moment when you\\'re presenting?Okay, so you start feeling anxiety.\", \"A few days before presentation?When does it start to get really distressing for you?Okay, so would you be okay if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of the presentation?\", \"Alright, so let\\'s so what\\'s one of the classes you\\'re taking now?So let\\'s say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now.\", \"I just have just a normal presentation.\", \"Yeah.\", \"All right.\", \"So, Let\\'s now move to two days out, where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it.\", \"Yeah.\", \"What\\'s going through your mind at that two day out point?All right.\", \"So your thought is, did I do enough preparation?So that\\'s that\\'s the thought you\\'re having 40 hours before the presentation.\", \"I\\'m not prepared enough.\", \"And kind of thinking about that thought.\", \"And what happens afterward?\", \"Do you have a reaction like any type of emotional, affective, affective reaction to that?And that goes substantially unchanged that feeling for how long?Right, so the same type of thought just more intense, more intense and the feeling is also more intense.sure you understand you\\'ve been having some symptoms which have been bothering you, but can you tell me what you think\\'s going on?You think you might be depressed?Have you ever felt this way in the past?having any feelings of sad sadness, hopelessness?yeah?trouble sleeping?Have you noticed a change in your ability to experience fun or pleasure?most time you\\'re sad, but you still have fun.\", \"Have you lost an interest in pursuing things that are fun?Any change in your appetite or weight in the last couple weeks?And you mentioned the sleep disturbance not been sleeping as much as you\\'d like to?So that\\'s been affecting your energy level?Do you feel restless or the opposite kind of slowed down and having either one of those feelings.have been having any feelings of worthlessness?like that?How about your concentration level any changes there?Have you been having any thoughts related to death or dying?So these symptoms you\\'ve been describing, have been causing limitations in your functioning in what areasAny drug or alcohol use?How about any medical conditions?see or hear things other people can\\'t see or hear?Has it ever happened to you?do you feel now recently wherever you\\'re at a state where you\\'re cheating too happy, like had a lot of energy and like mania?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Nothing like that.\", \"Ever.Has there been any major event in the last month?\", \"Or maybe before that did you think might be causing thisother than you think would cause depression.Sherry, I\\'m going to get you in to see a counselor here.\", \"Just take a couple days to get you in.\", \"Is that okay?\", \"I want to thank you for answering these questions.\", \"For me.\", \"This has been helpful.Want to thank you for continue to participate in this intake?\", \"As I mentioned, I want to move to a new section Now this one\\'s about your social relationships.\", \"Are you okay with answering some questions about your social relationships?Okay.\", \"Tell me about your friends.you start with high school,what behavior do you think?\", \"Did that?And was this all back in high school?Oh, recentlySo so you have a good number of friends in high school because of certain occurrences.\", \"You don\\'t have as many now?About how many close friends would you say you had?\", \"back in high school?And how about now?How many close friends do you have?Sure.\", \"Yeah.\", \"How many acquaintances?I haven\\'t met.fairly regularly.Can you describe to me your relationship with these?\", \"These 12 acquaintance?So you mentioned social media before, can you tell me about your interaction on social media?So a lot of people follow or read the posts?how about I want to ask you about interests like sports, music, the arts, television, you have any you mentioned social media seems like an interest and the other interestshow about talents?\", \"Do you have particular talents?shootout for meeting people and havingAny other talents?\", \"Like Tell me about?So, anything regarding social relationships, like your friends interest, talents, social media, anything you want to tell me on this before we move to the sectionyou feel like people, like people you mentioned that would see you on social media or your acquaintances, do you feel like they understand you?all of them or there\\'s some that?do you have any friends thatI want to thank you for helping me complete this section of the intake.\", \"And if you\\'re okay, we\\'ll move on to the next section.Hi How are you doing today?ok will tell me about the papers.Alright, so you, you have a five page paper, you sit down to work on it.\", \"You have the references, you get that part taken care of that then sounds like you kind of wander off a little bit.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then what happens after you are done wandering a little bit?So you are you\\'re finishing assignment on time.\", \"So the promise of latenessYou get done?So it\\'s really the how the time breaks out isn\\'t working out well for you.You\\'d rather not be doing it at the last moment.So these so these activities that you\\'re engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing, also regarding the references before you start writing.\", \"You said check an email.\", \"And other kind of sounds like unplanned small activities.These aren\\'t particularly engaging activities like something you need to do.\", \"No at that moment.So like distracted,And then there\\'s a moment you kind of catch yourself and realize you haven\\'t really started writing.is too late.\", \"Yeah, so you\\'re consuming time there.\", \"Alright.\", \"So you have a few different levels of activity.\", \"Here you have the paper, which it sounds like you\\'re okay writing but you\\'re you\\'re maybe not highly motivated to write.\", \"but you seem to be getting the references done.\", \"Okay.You collect the material, and then the writing part.\", \"That\\'s the difficult part.\", \"And then you have these behaviors.\", \"In the middle, which you enjoy doing a little, but they\\'re not something thatBut these behaviors still fulfill purpose they they do delay the writing of the paper.You may not be fully aware of that in a moment.\", \"But then you kind of become aware of that later that that\\'s the purpose that those behaviors accomplished was that they kept you distracted from writing.\", \"Alright.\", \"So the the writing of papers and activity, that\\'s a behavior that\\'s something you\\'re not really looking forward to.\", \"What\\'s the behavior That was an activity that you really do look forward to, you know, think about and some level of engagement is there.So so you\\'re excited about this television show and you how you have the episodes already recorded.\", \"And maybe one of the reasons you can\\'t find the time is because the time you\\'re using between the two parts of writing this paper.Right.\", \"So let\\'s let\\'s try this.\", \"When you when you do write to paper, you\\'re really writing it.\", \"The writing part, not the preparing part, but the writing part kind of all at the end.\", \"Right, getting it done this the night before it\\'s due.\", \"All right.\", \"So I want to try a couple different behavioral strategies here.\", \"Okay.\", \"And these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation.\", \"One is I think that it might be helpful and I want you let me know if I\\'m right here to break if it\\'s a five page paper to break it up into more than one night.\", \"Because right now, functionally, at least a lot of what you\\'re doing on the last night, okay.\", \"would be a more comfortable pace like Like, for example, how long does it take you to write one page?So around an hour to an hour and a half?\", \"You can complete one page.\", \"Edited proof read?Okay.\", \"So it would take about five days.\", \"To complete the whole paper, if you did an hour and a half each day, an hour to one I haven\\'t checked.\", \"Okay.\", \"But how much time do you have from when the papers assigned to when it\\'s due?I guess around 10 days.\", \"Yeah.pretty good time.\", \"So if you could work without distraction, you would be done by around 730 at the latest with this one page.no distractions.\", \"Just one page.\", \"Yeah.\", \"All right.\", \"So let\\'s talk about the the episodes, the TV episodes that you want to watch.\", \"Okay?\", \"How long are they,And once a time that you could watch those, you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching, like no distractions, I guess, Okay.\", \"So eight o\\'clock, so really good time for you to maximizeyou know, that\\'s a great motivator for you.\", \"And I want to try to use it as a motivator.\", \"Kind of like a reward.\", \"Okay, so I\\'d like you to try to do is when you start, like when you get all these papers assigned when the five, five page papers, pick the five nights that you want to work on it.\", \"Okay, it could be Monday through Friday or whatever works for you.\", \"All right, clearly within the 10 day window, though, all right, so five days within the 10 day window, do you have to turn in and then set that time at six o\\'clock is when you\\'re going to start because that\\'s a good time for you to work.Yeah, that\\'s sure.Yeah.\", \"And not waste that time in the middle.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Right.\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s really eating more time and your show takesDoes this make sense to you understand kind of,And I think that\\'s a that\\'s a helpful way to think about it.\", \"And that\\'s, that\\'s the cognitive part of this.\", \"So this is a kind of this is a behavioral strategy because we\\'ve talked about these in the past, right?\", \"This is behavioral strategy, the cognitive pieces, when you find yourself wandering, I think you have to detect that.\", \"And you I think you have some level awareness that\\'s happening.\", \"Yeah, you have to detect that and say, I want to watch my show, and we\\'re looking forward to it.\", \"And that\\'s your motivation to move through the paper.\", \"And then you know, when eight o\\'clock comes, okay.Very good.\", \"So let\\'s try that for.\", \"I\\'ll see again in roughly two weeks.All right.\", \"Thank you.\", \"Thanks.Good afternoon, Bruce.\", \"I\\'m glad you could make it in today.\", \"Thanks for coming in.\", \"Last week when you were you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana.\", \"And so we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use altogether.\", \"And how did you feel about our talk last week?Yeah.\", \"Just okay.All right.\", \"Okay, so I want to refresh your memory and I\\'ve got my notes here.\", \"Do you mind if I refer to my notes?\", \"yeah.I\\'m wondering what you could have done in the world.And so because of the not exercising, did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week?Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So how would you tie those two things together By not running?Yeah, yeah.\", \"So when you reflect back now on last week, and the rain coming down, and it was cold, I\\'m wondering if there was a way that you could change your perception about that, such that it wouldn\\'t stop you from running.\", \"What do you think?Mm hmm, that would be a great idea.\", \"That would be an excellent idea.So it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life?\", \"Last week?And  you tell me more but what was difficult about it,So you did it sounds like you didn\\'t want to hurt their feelings.by them thinking that you were going to avoid them.And so as a result of this what what happened?So because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them, you ended up using marijuana.\", \"Is that correct?And I\\'m wondering how you could do that differently this week.And what would that involve trying harder not to go see them?Yeah.\", \"Sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment.\", \"yourself and just drawing the line.\", \"And do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with?Okay.\", \"How about motivated on a scale of one to 10?\", \"Would you say you are to kind of reignite friendships with people that don\\'t smoke pot?Okay.\", \"So you\\'re still, you\\'re still a little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friends again, but I have to ask you, Bruce, what do you what made you say three instead of one?I think that\\'s great insight that you\\'re able to see that moving towards The friends that don\\'t smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly.\", \"And when you associated with the friends that didn\\'t smoke pot in the past, what kind of things did you do?Yeah.\", \"Was it fun to be with them?So you can recall living a healthier life then and having fun outdoors and basically having a healthier life overall, without using the pot.Sometimes it\\'s good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn\\'t smoke the pot because it makes you realize that you don\\'t really need it.\", \"And I think that\\'s a great, I think that\\'s a great idea.Okay, so you had some second thoughts about that.\", \"You\\'re excited about it and last week\\'s session, but after you had a chance to reflect upon it, you kind of realized that it wasn\\'t getting a dog was not the best Thanks for you, I think that\\'s wise to recognize that right up front, I\\'m given the research on pets any kind of pet, and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage.\", \"I\\'m wondering if there is another option that you might consider.\", \"I\\'m thinking, do you like pets that aren\\'t don\\'t require such a commitment?Because a dog is the dog is a large commitment.Hey, snakes !\", \"fish, that would definitely be a star these animals that you like.\", \"All right, I think it\\'s important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to.\", \"Alright, so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana.\", \"How did you make out with that?So you made the effort to go and you wentAnd so you didn\\'t stay the whole time.And so you left early because you felt you didn\\'t feel and you they were the bottom of the barrel and you\\'re still higher functioning.I can definitely understand I\\'m wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you.\", \"what Do you think?And what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group?So you\\'re you\\'re saying that the past of being in a support group would be that you\\'d get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey, and to have connections with other people.\", \"And again, I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot, but from increasing the feel good hormones in your body, the connection and the relating to other people.\", \"It might be similar when you were younger, you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player.\", \"And so you had support that was sort of like the team was sort of like a support group.\", \"I\\'m wondering if you could relate to people in head connections and wondering if you could see a support group as a team.And do you remember when you were playing hockey, how it felt to be encompassed in that team?\", \"It gave.\", \"And that\\'s because of those good feeling hormones that come in neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections.\", \"So how committed do you think you are?\", \"If I were to send you a list of support groups?\", \"So you could try out some others?\", \"Where there weren\\'t the bottom of the barrel?\", \"As you say, there?\", \"how committed Do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week?Wow.\", \"What made you say an eight rather than a four, five was justSo you thought How you remembered.\", \"You remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection?I love that analogy.\", \"Good thinking.\", \"It\\'s thinking, Bruce.\", \"That\\'s excellent.\", \"Wow.\", \"Well, just to summarize, today, you came in, you had made some progress, but you had some stumbling blocks.\", \"You have decided that whether it\\'s rain or shine, you\\'re going to run anyway, because you\\'re going to have you raincoat and you\\'re going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting it Dog, you\\'re going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing?\", \"Okay.\", \"And in terms of a support group, I will send you a list of support groups.\", \"And you feel that on a scale of one to 10, that you\\'re about an eight, and actually carrying through and trying out two of these support groups, because of the hockey team analogy.\", \"Great job.\", \"So overall, how would you rate today\\'s session?\", \"And if we were to put it on a scale of one to 10,out of eight.\", \"All right, we did get in if we did an eight.way to go.All right.\", \"ThanksSo Tommy, I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures from a party you were at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in your life.It\\'s kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority.\", \"Yeah.\", \"How much do you think you\\'re drinking?So you\\'re drinking maybe half the time depending on what\\'s going on that weekend.Well, how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don\\'t?so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends.\", \"When Don\\'t drink, but maybe you don\\'t feel like you can relax as well.You\\'re trying to be responsible and get your stuff done.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"And it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink?What are the things you enjoy about the drinking?Okay.\", \"So you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways?\", \"Yeah?\", \"Okay, are there any not so good things about drinking.What kinds of things happen?Like you notice in your body, how much do you think is the most you\\'ve ever drank in one time?that was out of the ordinary For you to discount, what\\'s a more typical amount that you drink?Got it.\", \"So you\\'re you\\'re sort of testing and pushing it in.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned.Well, kind of along those lines Looking ahead, you know, five years from now, what do you see as a goal for yourselfof what do you think you\\'ll be doing in five years,So getting a full experience is really important, too.\", \"It sounds like throughout your life, you know, you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience.\", \"And now you\\'re looking at how you can enrich your life in other ways.\", \"How do you think drinking too much would fit into, you know, being able to experience life to its fullest?Okay.\", \"So just to kind of summarize what you\\'ve told me so far, you\\'re you\\'re drinking pretty regularly, but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you\\'re having some of these negative consequences.\", \"And you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less,and then kind of looking ahead.\", \"You don\\'t want to Find yourself being someone who\\'s drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that you\\'ve seen that maybe in other people\\'s lives, and it\\'s not appealing to at all.\", \"And and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve, that drinking too much could also interfere with.\", \"So where do you think you want to go from here with with regard to your drinking?So for right now It feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you\\'re, you\\'re stopping three, for example, or maybe even limiting the number of times that you\\'re drinking.Okay.\", \"What do you see as some benefits to that?sticking to those limits?Yeah, I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea.\", \"And I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest question.\", \"You know, if you don\\'t mind, I would like to talk to probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months and just kind of check in how things are going.\", \"Right.\", \"All right.\", \"Sounds good.\", \"So we\\'re here today to talk about CBT and your experiences of it.\", \"How did you feel initially about the thought of going for CBTWas there anything about the CBT, in particular, that you found was helpful for you?whether any drawbacks to going for CBTSounds like it was a good experience for us.\", \"If you go Any advice that you would want to offer anyone who is thinking now about going for CBT?Alright, so let\\'s see if we could let\\'s rank those two things.\", \"Right so one is everyone\\'s judging me how I was and the other is a poor grade.\", \"Which one is larger fear for you?Okay, so the grades a concern.What would it mean?\", \"If they they thought you were anxious during that presentation?So if they notice your anxiety, then they think you don\\'t belong in that levelIf they don\\'t recognize those symptoms, they wouldn\\'t think that, do they?Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the programming room?So you\\'re a good student, you recognize that you have this one area where you don\\'t feel like you do a great job.\", \"That\\'s presentations.\", \"In terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation.\", \"But grades aside, you\\'re anxious.\", \"And you\\'re worried your classmates are gonna pick up on them.Okay.\", \"So if they thought you were us were imposter.\", \"So if they thought you were imposter to say that that was something they actually believe because of what\\'s been happening.\", \"What would that mean?\", \"What would it mean to your classmates that you were an imposter?You don\\'t deserve to be there.So if they believe you\\'re an imposter based on these physical symptoms, like anxiety and mood that means to you anyway, that that means you shouldn\\'t be on there.What\\'s it feel like to say thatJust think this whole time you really been given faking Do you really belong there?.\", \"So I\\'d like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence.\", \"So in this kind of therapy, we like to look at what, you know, what we\\'re feeling and what we\\'re thinking, and what\\'s we can see what\\'s observable around us.\", \"And, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it, okay.\", \"You\\'re worried at some level.\", \"You\\'re worried that you don\\'t deserve to be where you are right now.\", \"Yeah.\", \"That you\\'re not good enough.\", \"To be a student in this program, yeah, programming.\", \"What evidence supports that belief that you\\'re not good enough?what\\'s going on that day.So even if you survived the program, somehow you might be bad at your jobany other evidence that points toward you being imposter?Right.\", \"So to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I\\'m not good enough is kind of based on your feelings of anxiety.Yeah so in a way you\\'re believing With the anxiety will lead you to believe.But in the bright light of scrutiny, there are a lot of facts to support the worst case, which is you don\\'t deserve it.\", \"How about evidence that refutes that you\\'re not good enough?Okay, so you\\'ve got through a rigorous process to become a student You\\'re doing well.\", \"You mentioned before, just the one bad grade right?\", \"Okay, so if you have friends in this program, right, if one of them came to you with this, this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety, yeah, versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well, otherwise, what advice would you give them?would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself?So, so let\\'s look at the the thought and the feeling.\", \"If you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, like right now right now, yeah, but here with me.\", \"How much of your mind believes that that\\'s true?So right now you\\'re really not buying the idea that you\\'re not good enough.So now let\\'s move to let\\'s say right in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there, and the classmates that could be looking at you, it could be negatively evaluating you because you\\'re worried about how much do you believe that thought then?Yeah.\", \"really intense.\", \"So would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what\\'s true or not.\", \"Now, or when you\\'re in that state of anxiety,So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that true, this evaluation is more accurate?And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood right now, or you can evaluate accurately?okay.\", \"So the, so you\\'re able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right?\", \"There\\'s a limited amount of time when you\\'re not when there\\'s A lot of motions going through, right?\", \"And at those times, you\\'re maybe a little less reliable,However, in that moment you still, those thoughts are strong, right?\", \"Even though it\\'s a small percentage, it\\'s intense.\", \"And you kind of carry that around a little bit.So I can see why this is frustrating for you.Okay, Charles, let\\'s take a look at your homework from last week the activity schedule.I\\'ll take a look at it and see, well, you did complete most of it.So it was tough.\", \"And I just want to be clear, though, Charles that this is very typical though for many people that we work with.\", \"It\\'s very difficult to complete homework worksheets, because things happen, right?\", \"I don\\'t feel that Well, sometimes things get in the way.\", \"There\\'s things that just prevent me from doing that.\", \"So I think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult.\", \"So what would you say what would be some barriers that made it difficult to Your mastery ratings.Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Well, I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things.\", \"versus the cons.\", \"So there\\'s a worksheet that I have called a decisional balance worksheet.\", \"And it basically takes two separate decisions.\", \"One decision is to engage in activities, and there\\'s some benefit to doing that.\", \"And then another decision would be to not engage in activities.\", \"There\\'s benefit to that.\", \"But there\\'s also cost to both of those decisions.\", \"So I think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there\\'s more benefit or cost to completing that?\", \"What do you think about that?Okay, that\\'s a great idea.\", \"So what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch?Okay, that sounds great.\", \"So sounds like one benefit would be you\\'d enjoy the company.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And you wouldn\\'t be as lonely.\", \"So I\\'d write that down.\", \"Okay, good.Okay, can you think of the downside to potentially doing that?Okay, orSo it sounds like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy.Okay.\", \"So I\\'d write that is a great job Charles with the top two boxes with the first decision.\", \"So let\\'s move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same and there\\'s some benefit to that and there\\'s some cost to that as well.\", \"Sure.\", \"Okay, Charles, so we completed the worksheet.\", \"So what\\'s your overall impression about the benefits of changing versus the cons and staying the same?Those are good observations, Charles.\", \"So, which activity doesn\\'t make the most sense to try for homework this week?Okay, that\\'s a good observation.\", \"So, let\\'s say for homework, then you tried to call someone to get together with a friend.\", \"And how about also trying to complete a full day of the activity schedule, and completing both the mastery and the pleasure ratings?\", \"What do you think about that?Okay.\", \"And if it gets Difficult, which again, that\\'s pretty normal for that to take place.\", \"If it gets hard, we can talk about it next time and we can problem solve together and figure out how to remove those barriers.\", \"Does that sound good?How are you doing today?What\\'s been going on?talk about that?So when you go into store, if you just have one thing you want to buy one item you went there for you will buy a second item or even more just Second,So you have to leave having purchased a minimum of two, right?\", \"Or if you can\\'t find something else, you won\\'t buy it at all.\", \"Exactly.\", \"So So zero would also be acceptable.But one, And what happens that has ever been the occasion where you\\'ve only purchased one thing?\", \"So for all this period of time, you have successfully either purchase nothing, or two or more items.how anxiety producingYou know, what would happen?\", \"give a specific.So something really, really bad will happen.\", \"This is hurtful for you.\", \"This is causing you pain.\", \"And this would happen.\", \"This would really happen on any shopping trip where you just want one thing you\\'d be reminded, so if you went in wanting more than one thing, it\\'s not a problem, right?Alright, so how often does this happen?\", \"Where you are in a situation where you want to make a purchase of just one item?\", \"And you have to you have to change because the anxiety daily?I would like fill up your car gasoline.So it has an effect that level two.So you\\'re thinking it almost like the number of transactions has to be more than one.\", \"I mean, it has to be two or zero.That\\'s one transaction and one thing and one thing, okay.\", \"And then.\", \"Okay, so that\\'s one product, right?\", \"And you need another product.\", \"Right?\", \"So you really can\\'t feel your car without going inside the station.\", \"Store.So it doesn\\'t matter that there\\'s more than one gallon going in, is because it\\'s the same product.\", \"So I could see now this, this would be more of a daily thing.\", \"You said, Right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Because at first I was thinking daily.\", \"That\\'s a lot of individual shopping trips, but it applies to all transaction.\", \"So this is a fairly significant source of anxiety for you.So let\\'s talk about that.\", \"And help me to understand this better.\", \"So let\\'s say that you went to a convenience store, and just had one thing in mind, what might be a potential item that you would gum?\", \"gum, right?\", \"So you want to go in and you just want to buy a pack of gum.\", \"That\\'s all you really want.\", \"That\\'s why you stopped at the store.\", \"So you go in, you have any thoughts?\", \"Now we talked in the past about automatic thoughts, these thoughts just kind of come in, right.\", \"So are there any thoughts in there happening when you\\'re walking into the store?All right.\", \"So the thought is What else can I get?\", \"Yeah, like this one, the past will be two has to be two.\", \"It has to be two.\", \"That\\'s not that\\'s Yeah.\", \"So that\\'s also possible more demanding.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So it has to be.to the anxiety.\", \"So is the anxietyso it\\'s really graduallyAlright, so you so really the the worst anxiety would be approaching the store entering in that moment of uncertainty.\", \"When you don\\'t know the second Yeah,Okay.\", \"So if you could relieve that anxiety, that would be one of your goals.\", \"All right.\", \"So let\\'s think about this way.\", \"Do you?\", \"Do you know the reason that you do this?\", \"You have any guesses?Alright.\", \"So you\\'ve been through some really tough times to put it mildly.\", \"And what You\\'re afraid of if you only buy the one item?\", \"Is something safety related happening?And I guess security like theSo safety and security.\", \"They\\'re at risk for you.When you don\\'t follow this role, the rule and I will Yeah.\", \"So if we think about it in terms of the cognitive model, we talked about the core beliefs and the intermediate beliefs, which are the attitudes and assumptions expectations, so the core belief here the only thoughts when it might beI\\'m not okay.\", \"I\\'m not safe.\", \"I am vulnerable,Sure at risk?\", \"Yeah.And then when a situation presents itself, which would be an impending transaction.\", \"That\\'s the situation we talked about how the situation blends together.\", \"With that, in this case rule that intermediate.\", \"So when they come together, what\\'s that automatic thought?trends potential transactions approaching you, and you handed me a belief I need to buy everythingAnd then what\\'s the behavior?\", \"That is a product of that automatic thought of I do you buy the second item?\", \"Yeah.\", \"And the feeling is the feeling of falls.well, the follows on Mac thought, oh, anxiety, anxiety, and then what\\'s the feeling that follows the purchase?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Relief relief.\", \"Alright.\", \"So can you see how the mechanism what\\'s happening to you could be explained one explanation through through the cognitive loadAlright.\", \"So let\\'s talk about the rule of the Rule of Two.\", \"Now we, we, we talked before, we\\'re talking about cognitive therapy, about useful and less than useful thoughts, right?\", \"functional and less functional or dysfunctional.\", \"thoughts.\", \"Do you think that sitting here now, not so much necessarily in the store?\", \"I know that\\'s probably a different thought process.\", \"But talking with me now, do you see a causal connection between purchasing two items and a safety or security breach?it\\'s not a useful in this case thought munei useful intermediate belief.So you recognize that you appreciate that.\", \"There is not a link between Elio purchasing here.\", \"And in either direction, though, right meaning, so you realize that, that if you buy to, this doesn\\'t necessarily keep you safe either.\", \"So you can\\'t introduce safety or the process of risk of being unsafe, you can\\'t introduce risk or safety through your transacting behavior.Does that make sense?So do overs or rest are not influenced by your behavior.But that\\'s not what your mind is telling you.\", \"That\\'s not what your thoughts are telling you.\", \"That\\'s logical.\", \"And you can sit here with me.\", \"And it\\'s not easy to say, but you can say, Yeah, I don\\'t see a link.So let\\'s talk about that moment.\", \"So in this moment, maybe a little anxious now, but you can kind of see how, right you can\\'t protect yourself or cause harm to yourself or anyone else.\", \"By buying to or failing to buy to write in the store, or wherever you make the transaction, different story.\", \"So you have, let\\'s, let\\'s go a different direction.\", \"I talked about how you walk into a store, and you think, well, I get those the phone, right?\", \"And you end up getting something else.\", \"Yes, the anxiety then kind of goes away.\", \"And we\\'ll come up the next time that happens.\", \"But it\\'s a way it\\'s gone for that moment.\", \"So, I want you to kind of stay with me as I go through another scenario.\", \"And you maybe have figured out what I\\'m going to do here, butSo maybe GM isn\\'t the ideal example but you see my right yeah.\", \"See, you go into the now you go to the store, you realize you only have enough resources to make the one transaction and you really want it so zero is not.\", \"So, now walk me through the thoughts and the feelingswould think would happenCould you do it?And that is one level of being able.\", \"But how about in terms of your thinking?\", \"And your feeling?And what would happen?\", \"How much anxiety with you experience and with the anxiety fade off?Are you worried is the kind of anxiety where you\\'re worried that something catastrophic is gonna happen?\", \"Okay, so even talking about a transaction of one can lead to anxiety connected to this safety and security.\", \"So you can you can trigger that without a transaction even pending.really scared sitting here.is unbearable the anxiety of men\\'s embarrassment?but does it hurt stuff?What do you feel is gonna happen with seeing xiety aboutOkay, so it\\'s not a safety and security.\", \"It\\'s a it\\'s a concern about going through and buying one item on the rule.\", \"Those two Yeah, yeah.\", \"And I\\'m talking about breaking the rule.\", \"Because so you\\'re anxious about that.\", \"And you\\'re also anxious about the consequences of that.So the anxiety you\\'re experiencing right now in this moment with me, I want you to be mindful that, guys keep that in your awareness and let me know if that changes.\", \"just interrupt me if you need to.\", \"It\\'s not.So it might get worse.\", \"It might get better.\", \"So, is there something on your mind that you need to buy within the next couple of days?That\\'s a transaction of one.Okay, right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"understandable, but what if, what if I challenged you to behavioral Experiment.\", \"Okay, can you guess what that might be?to buy one to buy one cup of coffee?\", \"And then I don\\'t know where to buy the coffee, but leave?\", \"Yeah, wherever it is leave.\", \"So what are the possible things that could happen?\", \"Knowing that logically you can connect it to a safety thing, and you might be anxious about that.\", \"And that\\'s real, that anxiety is real.\", \"But knowing that the event isn\\'t prevented or caused by exactly the transacting behavior.\", \"Let\\'s go through what happens.\", \"So you buy the coffee.\", \"You\\'re really anxious.\", \"Right?\", \"up to it, you\\'re anxious to go into driving there either.Would it go away?So it\\'d be more painful experience to buy the one.But it wouldn\\'t actually harm you.But it would cause you more internal anxiety.\", \"So what would happen if you did again,repeated 100 times.So really, what you\\'re doing is you\\'re conditioning you\\'d be conditioning yourself right to, to to surviving just buying the one item.\", \"I have a lot more money financial advantages to it certainly.\", \"And there\\'d be a you know what I hope is a freedom advantage which is the freedom to buy any number of miners, the next so what what scenario of purchasing i know i i asked for the coffee example I mean I asked one thing you\\'re going to buy the coffee, but what what scenario could you see yourself being most likely to fall through this?\", \"I don\\'t know if the coffee is the optimal situation for that behavior experiment maybe I guess it would there be another item that would be easier to actually fall through like for example, the gasoline because you\\'d get your car by the gasoline and you leave.\", \"Yeah, that would be easier for you.\", \"You will be tempted by the other Iwood.\", \"That\\'d be easy.\", \"It\\'d be, you know, might beSo we will, we will consider that kind of a step in a direction that would result in fewer symptoms.\", \"Yeah, that would be wonderful.\", \"And maybe another step in the future if we get there.\", \"So it goes with us, but it would be to go into the store and buy one but let\\'s not let\\'s not do that.\", \"Okay.\", \"Let\\'s stick with the gasoline.You feel like you could succeed with that.\", \"Yeah, experiment.are you afraid with the coffee that you might just end up buying too?\", \"Okay.So how\\'s your anxiety now?Okay, so that was a stressor.But mostly because the experiment that we\\'re talking about somewhat easierSo one of the we talked about before, what do I mag thoughts like adaptive responses, right.\", \"So as you\\'re trying to kind of push through this experience of just feeling car, you\\'re going to have those thoughts still come up.\", \"And the adaptive response could be something like, Well, I\\'d like you to design it or work with me and design it.\", \"But could be something like, I know this will actually have a consequence in the real world.\", \"Yeah, I realized this is just how responding internally doesn\\'t take away the anxiety, necessarily.\", \"It might, but it will help you maybe get through that process.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Yeah, absolutely.\", \"There\\'s a few things I\\'m asking you to do.\", \"Right.\", \"One is to just buy gasoline needed and only by gasoline.\", \"And at the same time when those thoughts come up to respond to them with the adaptive responses to compare the two.Apparently got it.\", \"Right.\", \"So I know this won\\'t have real consequence.\", \"In reality, that could be one.\", \"And if you have any others, you know, you can apply to as well as apply them.\", \"I know that I can tolerate the anxiety.\", \"Yeah, seems like you\\'ve tolerated for a long time.\", \"It\\'s not pleasant.\", \"It\\'s not what you want.\", \"But you can tolerate.And maybe another adapter response would be, this is painful for me.\", \"But if I can be successful here, if I can get rid of things,And keeping your island moving up to coffee and other other behavioral goals.\", \"Like that.\", \"Yeah, that makes sense.So we\\'re kind of attacking anxiety from a lot of different angles here.\", \"Okay?So do you do believe that you can succeed with this idea?Yeah.\", \"So well, that can be very Positive so that you know what I detected there was, you\\'re ready to challenge the six idea.\", \"Right?\", \"Like, I would like to take the devil\\'s courage.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"So you\\'re ready to say I\\'ve had enough.\", \"And you can see a clear path of behavior that can help you get through it and you\\'re ready to take the anxiety on.\", \"That can be a positive adaptive response, right?\", \"Like being assertive and saying, almost like you\\'re talking to the anxiety in a way okay, right, but I\\'m not gonna let you beat me this time.\", \"That\\'s what you\\'d be saying to the anxiety.So, make a note of all these right?\", \"And you can use the same one more than once.\", \"You can mix them up, whatever works for you.\", \"Okay, but keep applying them as needed through the whole process into your home, your is your no more risk to go by.\", \"It\\'s great.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Cuz it because I think once you get home really, that\\'s, that\\'s the completion of only participating that one transaction right, you\\'ve left and go back to restarting the cycle.\", \"So right.\", \"you\\'ve, you\\'ve permanently recorded just buying the one thing.\", \"Yeah, so that\\'s a victory.\", \"Yeah.\", \"That\\'d be a huge victory.\", \"So I don\\'t know if you know the status of your gas tank right now.\", \"Do you foresee needing to get gas between now and next week?So if you could try that out.\", \"And if you could record kind of in the moment, like after it\\'s over the experience in terms of your feelings, different stages, that would be helpful.\", \"Do you have on your presentation?\", \"Do you have so many?\", \"Like bullet points you want to cover?\", \"Like,Okay.\", \"Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points?I don\\'t know how many bullet points you\\'d have in a presentation.\", \"Maybe you\\'d have 10 or 20.\", \"Yeah, depending on how long right so maybe you as you start to review a certain bullet point As you\\'re trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply.\", \"And then as you continue on, you just let out that breath really slowly, I thought about it that way.\", \"I\\'m just thinking it\\'d be some way to structure.\", \"So you would, you would get in so many breaths,Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit.\", \"Okay.\", \"Just make sure you keep your bullet points of length.\", \"About a few paragraphs.\", \"Yeah.\", \"But just just a few seconds each.\", \"So you can get a good deep breath and, or you could, you know, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously, several breaths, but just some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Because I know that.\", \"In that moment, things are probably like you mentioned zoning out and right It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths.\", \"And that might be something you can really have one too.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And would we kind of cut through that fogginess something could still do.\", \"Okay.\", \"When\\'s the next presentation in that class that\\'s coming up?Is that the next presentation you have?\", \"Like in all the classes is the oneOkay.\", \"And that\\'s next Friday.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"Do you know where you are in the order?\", \"Like for presenting?not first.\", \"And this one\\'s how many minutesOkay, it\\'s a little shorter than 20 minutes.\", \"So you have about a half hour, maybe a little more, if there\\'s time to switch out of kind of sitting there, right.\", \"And potential time where you could be anxious.\", \"Yes, but also potential time and you could be reviewing the notes your bullet points and breathing.And saying to yourself, that\\'s so like, kind of self talk, that they\\'re not really paying attention to me anyway.\", \"Right.\", \"Right.\", \"Because that might help reduce that.\", \"That anxiety.\", \"Yeah.\", \"What\\'s one thing you could say to yourself when you\\'re up there?Okay, so the sort of self talk up there could be I deserve to be here.I\\'ve prepared enough.\", \"I\\'m a good student.\", \"I deserve to be here.Is that something that would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can?Yeah, internally as you because it\\'s not long.And how much do you believe that those statements are true?Okay, so there\\'s those self talk items.\", \"You believe them to be true.\", \"Yeah, but you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this.\", \"You might not believe them as much, right?\", \"But remember that, you know, we worked on them.\", \"Right?\", \"You came up with them.And you believe them now.\", \"Right?\", \"So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself.\", \"Then the chaos of anxiety in the words is harder.\", \"So the more tasks you can make concrete, and you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you\\'ll be.\", \"Okay.\", \"I would like to see you your presentations next Friday.\", \"Yeah, I would like to see you right before that.\", \"So be about a week.\", \"Okay for that.\", \"Do you have any questions?\", \"These are items you can rehearse still even without the presentation, the self talk and write the breathing, and of course preparing.\", \"But you have any questions between now and then you think?Understand kind of the plan to attack that anxiety symptomRight.\", \"So, so good.\", \"So you have some kind of behavioral pieces.\", \"Focus on studying the breathing.\", \"And so cognitive pieces that the self talk we talked about, yeah.\", \"That you use when you\\'re seated and use when you\\'re at the podium,And actually presenting.\", \"Alright, good.\", \"So I\\'m glad we have a plan going forward.\", \"I think that you did a really good job today, helping kind of untangle this and figure out what\\'s going on.\", \"And I appreciate that.\", \"You were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they\\'re related.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I feel like this is something that\\'s going to serve you well as you move through this.\", \"All right.\", \"So I\\'ll see you in, in a week.\", \"Thanks, Hazel.So Sam is healthy other than some seasonal allergies and everything else Okay, then.Okay, so sounds like there\\'s a little bit more going on that and some more worries that you wanted to talk about.\", \"So perhaps it makes sense that, that we take a few minutes and then I chat with you, and then I\\'ll spend a few minutes with Sam.\", \"Sure.\", \"It\\'ll be great.\", \"Okay, Sam, do you want to go in, hang out in the waiting room for bed and I\\'ll come find you in a few minutes.\", \"Go ahead, honey.\", \"So tell me about Sam and the issues that he\\'s having in school.a real diversion from last year real change from last year.\", \"Oh, totally like night and day.\", \"Okay, so it sounds like there\\'s been some problems at home.\", \"So I\\'m going to ask you some screening questions that I asked all the parents, some of them might fit for you.\", \"And some of them may not probably take about five minutes, and we\\'ll just go through them together.\", \"Sure, let\\'s do it.\", \"So why don\\'t we start with how you\\'re doing?So is he seeing Sam at all, or?So has that meant that finances have been tight or?So lots of changes, lots of things going on.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And how do you feel like you\\'re managing with all that?Emotionally, how have you been doing them and managing things are So there are ever any times that you\\'re not managing well, like you\\'re not good at able to get out of bed or do the things that you need to do in a day.So some struggles but yeah, okay.\", \"Do you ever cope with using drugs or alcohol?So then no drinking at all at home?What about making sure that Sam and your little one have what they need in terms of winter coats or food or or those sorts of things?So he\\'s wearing his coat from last year.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Do you have a sense about is that hard because of finances are there other reasonsRight.\", \"So Sam\\'s not always having the things that he needs right now then.Yeah.\", \"And what about you know food or you deserve food in the fridge?\", \"Are you able to put food on the courseAnd what kinds of things does Sam have for dinner?I was what would you say he does?\", \"Is he cooking?\", \"Or are you cooking or both?So with all the stress in the house, has there been any times that people have kind of gotten really upset with Sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful things to him?And what about how his discipline handled in your house?\", \"Has anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt Sam in any way?What about sexual abuse?\", \"Has anyone touched Sam in a sexual way or an inappropriate way?\", \"Excuse me?\", \"Yeah, that\\'s a hard question to hear for lots of people.\", \"But I asked everybody that question,So, so he\\'s been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch.\", \"Okay.\", \"So how do you think Sam\\'s doing in his close family relationships do you think Sam\\'s feeling loved And supported.So what do you think he would say if he was here?\", \"And I asked him if he felt loved.There\\'s some doubt?You mentioned that there was some some some difficulties with your mom.has there been any time that your mom has become physically aggressive in the home?And what about her relationship with you?\", \"How is she managing or how are you managing together with her in the home?And Has it ever come to physical blows between the two of you?And when you mean arguments how intense are those arguments getting?Is it ever it\\'s never come to physical blows?And that, that that intensity, is that kind of like arguing or is it like yelling, screaming and door slamming or people throwing objects?And where are Sam and the baby when these things are happening?so it sounds like there\\'s kind of a lot of tension and, and, and arguing in that relationship.\", \"How often would you say that that\\'s happening that it comes to that kind of arguing and yelling place?Can one sort of last question what has anyone in your family been in prison or in jail?Okay.\", \"So thank you very much for sharing all of that.\", \"I\\'m just going to recap.\", \"Sounds like there\\'s been a lot of stressors and lots of change over the last year.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Sam status moved away, which is kind of created some changes in finances, which have led to, maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you\\'ve needed or that Sam has needed.\", \"You\\'ve got, your mom has moved in, and there\\'s some stress and tension and arguing that\\'s happening in that.\", \"And you\\'ve also told me that maybe all of these stressors and stuff have contributed to Sam not feeling as loved or as cared for.\", \"On the other hand, it sounds like you\\'re managing emotionally and that you\\'re not using any drugs or alcohol.\", \"You have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical, emotional or sexual abuse.\", \"For Sam and his life, and that nobody in your family more in Sam\\'s life has gone to prison.\", \"So I think you\\'re right there is likely a connection between kind of what\\'s happening for Sam in school and the difficulties that he\\'s starting to have with all of these stresses and changes at home.\", \"So I\\'m going to book a follow up appointment for you and Sam to come in.\", \"And at that time, we\\'ll talk about some of the ways in which I might be able to help or develop a plan together.All right.\", \"So make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in as soon as you can.\", \"Okay.Yeah.\", \"You gotta see Sam right now.\", \"And then when when I\\'m done, just make sure on the way that you talk to reception about making another appointment.\", \"Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Exactly.\", \"Last All right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Thanks.\", \"Jessica, what\\'s that?\", \"doing?\", \"Okay.\", \"I understand you\\'ve been having some recent difficulties that brought you into our agency.\", \"Can you tell me about that?Anxiety?So, so you\\'re anxious when you\\'re getting ready to go to work.\", \"Do you know what might be causing that?Right.\", \"So you, you went out to Cory so some damage reminded you of an accident.\", \"Yeah,They said the exit occurred at the end of last year.So maybe about eight months ago.And when did the symptoms start being anxious when you\\'re getting ready to go to work?And you\\'ve been having those continuously from then.Ever been late to work because of the anxiety?almost every day.\", \"So this has been this has been a problem for you in a few different ways.Have you tried a thing to reduce things IE like using another car or anything else?Right, and you\\'re having physical distress, too?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Like you\\'re feeling.\", \"You\\'re feelingOr you\\'re having dreams about the accident or anything related to the accident?Do you ever have a point when you\\'re not asleep?\", \"Where you feel like you\\'re kind of taken back to the time of the accident happened like a reliving it anyway?\", \"Do you remember the accident?Who do you believe is responsible for the accident?So from the time that you notice these anxiety symptoms, have you had periods where you were happy and positive emotional experiences.The whole time you\\'ve been down or the moments where you haven\\'t been there\\'s been consistently downbut but sometimes upHow about your relationships with other people they changed from when was the anxiety started?You feel detached from people?not connecting with people?\", \"Do you have any feelings of irritability or anger outbursts or anything like that?You feel like you\\'ve been behaving more reckless way?That you take more chances in relationships or another nothing like that you\\'re aware of like when something surprises us, we kind of have the startle response.\", \"Jump.\", \"It\\'s natural.\", \"Have you noticed that?\", \"responses changed?\", \"OhAnd you feel like the responses more than it used to be more just the natural star response.A trouble concentrating.?\", \"Okay, Australia.\", \"staying focused has beenHow about troubled sleep?\", \"trouble falling asleep staying asleep?So you\\'re getting to sleep Okay, falling asleep.\", \"Okay, but just having trouble staying asleep.\", \"Are you thinking of anything specific when you wake up?any use of drugs or alcohol?How about medical problems?\", \"Are there ever points from an anxiety started, that you feel kind of outside of your own body Come an unreal feeling where you\\'re separated from your body?How about times when you feel disconnected from the environment, like an unreal feeling about what\\'s going on around you?\", \"Jessica, I\\'m going to get you in to see a counselor here.\", \"If you\\'re open to that, that\\'s something you want to do.\", \"Yes.\", \"And I appreciate you taking the time to tell me what\\'s going on and answer these questions.\", \"It\\'s been helpful.\", \"Hello, Peggy, how you doing today?you\\'re okay.\", \"Glad to hear that.\", \"Yesterday, when you\\'re here at the agency, you took a few different tests.\", \"Remember that?One of the tests you took is called the SCL 90, the symptom checklist 90.\", \"Do you remember taking that test?It\\'s 90 items.\", \"And they are rankedNot true and false are numbers that you solve.So I have the results from that test.\", \"I want to review some of those findings with you.\", \"So this particular instrument has a number of what we refer to as sub scales.\", \"So these are areas that are measured by the instrument, right?\", \"For example, depression or anxiety.\", \"So I\\'m going to review a few of these sub scales, ones where you scored a little higher than we might expect.\", \"And just review those with you and see.\", \"See what you\\'re thinking we can talk about.NoIs it what makes you think I\\'m recording?It happens to you a lot that you get recorded.\", \"Remember the last time it happened?And you think you were recorded while you\\'re taking this?That sounds worrisome.\", \"That\\'s that\\'s a feeling you get a lot that you\\'re being recorded.You worry about it a lot.You\\'re certain that\\'s happening?Where you\\'re not being recorded now.\", \"I know.\", \"It probably feels like you are, but you\\'re not.\", \"Okay.\", \"in school, right?\", \"I that would make sense.\", \"So, say for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65% Right percentile, that would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of people that took that test.\", \"Okay, so that makes sense.\", \"So if you took a test on math or English, and you would say 75 percentile, you\\'d be higher than three quarters of people took the test.\", \"75% Okay, understand?\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"I think so.\", \"Okay.\", \"If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn\\'t make sense, okay.\", \"So areas here on on the SCL results, or you were a bit higher than we would normally see.\", \"A one is the phobic anxiety scale.\", \"on that one, you were about 64 percentile.\", \"So your score was as high or higher.\", \"Than 64% of people who take it more than half the number and half the people in the same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment.It does seem that way.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So this construct would measure things like being afraid of going out being afraid of being a crowds.\", \"Does that connect with you?\", \"Is that seem like a fear that you have?Tell me about that.So it does appear you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms.\", \"So that that score today that 64 percentile.\", \"That kind of makes sense.I want to move on to the next one, which is paranoia.\", \"On this one, you were at the 84th.\", \"percentile.\", \"So quite a bit higher.But this, this wasn\\'t recorded, nothing was recorded here.\", \"Understand that\\'s a worry that you have.in your particular case, the only people will be shared with this the rest of the treatment team and anybody that you sign a release for,There\\'s no reason right now I did that there are certain limits to confidentiality.\", \"But in your situation here at this clinic, there\\'s no reason I would share this information with the government or, or anybody else other than people indicated.\", \"So the rest of the people here to treat you.\", \"And if you wanted to release the results to somebody, you could sign a release I would let them have the results.Well, I assume you\\'re worried thatOh, I understand.\", \"Okay.\", \"So these things are really happening.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Right.\", \"But the test is arranged so that it\\'s making it look paranoid when you\\'re not exactlySo that would explain why your score is elevated on the scale.\", \"Okay.\", \"Is that?\", \"Is that what you\\'re thinking?\", \"And I wanted you to know that.\", \"I appreciate you telling me that.\", \"Do you think it\\'s possible that it\\'s working the other way around that the test is measuring something that is actually there?You don\\'t think so.\", \"Okay.you believe their situation is different than yours.\", \"Okay, I understand.\", \"So the last area, the last subscale I want to discuss this one global scale on discuss.\", \"Glass subscale is one that\\'s referred to as psychoticism.\", \"And there you are at the 93rd percentile.\", \"And that\\'s when maybe you can hear things other people hear or see things that people don\\'t see, or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside the norm and can\\'t be supported by evidence.\", \"They feel like that\\'s happening to you.There\\'s There\\'s nothing here that would indicate that I\\'m gonna put you away or center anywhere.\", \"Yeah, I just really this The purpose of this is just to discuss the results to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you.\", \"Like so we\\'re gonna provide treatment to impart based on these results.Okay, so this is a this is a score that makes makes sense to retake the test might be right.but you believe you\\'re being recorded, you\\'re starting to that.Well, a little bit higher than we want to see.So at the Paranoid if that if that scale was accurate, in your estimation, your global severity might be lower, I think, yeah.\", \"Closer to the 50 percentile, I think.\", \"So, even if you were closer to the 50 percentile, you can To understand how we\\'re concerned that your symptoms are somewhat severe, and we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that.\", \"Sure.\", \"Is that okay?So I will meet with the counselor that will be treating, you\\'re here, and I\\'m going to go over these scores now explain to her what you\\'ve explained to me.\", \"Okay, in terms of why you think you might have received the score.\", \"Okay, I\\'ll go over that with her.\", \"And of course, you could discuss it with her too, and she\\'ll have the results of this test in your chart.\", \"She, she\\'s not going to be

worried about your drinking.\", \"Tell me about your drinking.So sometimes at work, you\\'ve been having cravings for alcohol and the other There are times when you will have a craving?So other than that feeling of having the craving, is there anything you do after you have a craving?How much do you drink?Is this when you work in a day?\", \"So when you\\'re having cravings at work, you\\'re not drinking there?Right.\", \"So tell me about your typical alcohol consumption week.You\\'re worried that the craving is indicating you have an alcohol problem?Have you ever tried to cut down your drinking and you\\'re unable to do so?You spend a lot of time trying to obtain alcohol.How about in terms of your responsibilities?\", \"Have you failed to uphold any responsibilities because you\\'re drinking?\", \"Or you have any social problems because you\\'re drinking.It doesn\\'t cause social problems.\", \"Do you find yourself giving up important activities because you\\'re drinking instead?So thinking about it, maybe still some craving, but you\\'re still going.\", \"You\\'re still participating.Are you engaging in activities that are dangerous?Drinking and driving?There\\'s nothing like that.\", \"Yeah.Do you have any medical or mental health problems in general?Do you find that you have to increase the amount of alcohol you\\'re drinking to get the same effect?all right, and you\\'ve been drinks you save a drink about the same amount each time you drink.\", \"Have you noticed that the effect has been diminished, like you\\'re not getting the same effect from the alcohol?Goes same way.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Have you ever noticed any symptoms when you stop drinking, like withdrawal?Like when you stop using alcohol, are you finding that you\\'re anxious, depressed, you have physical reactions like that.\", \"Okay, Jackie, I appreciate you.\", \"Tell me about what\\'s going on and answer my questions.\", \"If you\\'re okay with it, I\\'ll get you in to

agency.so you feel like you\\'re, you\\'re drinking more than usual.\", \"How much are you drinking now?three or four nights a week?\", \"And how much are you drinking each time to go?Alright, so do you know how much alcohol you consume in the time period.\", \"Do you know how much you\\'re actually drinking?So do you find that you need to drink more to get the desired effect?Have you made any attempts to cut down on consumption?It\\'s okay.\", \"So, I want to talk about the time you spend using alcohol.\", \"Are you are you okay with the amount of time you mentioned that you\\'re using for longer periods?\", \"But are you okay with?\", \"Or is that something that\\'s distressing you?Do you find that you have a craving for alcohol?So you\\'re thinking about it, but you also like feeling the craving.You mentioned work, you\\'re having trouble with responsibilities at work or any other area?Have you had any social problems due to the alcohol?All right.\", \"So no social problems.\", \"Have you had to give up any important activities because of the alcohol use?You haven\\'t missed any important activities.\", \"How about engaging in activities that are physically dangerous?Do you

any drug use?So it\\'s just alcohol?All right.\", \"When you stopped drinking, do you have any physical symptoms or anxiety any symptoms of withdrawal?Okay, so that\\'s not a problem.\", \"All right.\", \"Jackie, open to Receiving counseling services or agency?\", \"I think okay, okay.\", \"All right.\", \"I\\'m gonna get you scheduled in to see a counselor.\", \"I want to thank you for telling me about what\\'s going on for answering my questions.\", \"It\\'s been helpful.So Charles, it sounds like things have been going pretty well recently,That\\'s good.\", \"That\\'s good.\", \"Charles, I\\'m proud of you for taking the initiative.\", \"Because I know it\\'s been difficult in the past and you\\'ve really championed the things we\\'ve talked about, and I\\'m really proud of you for that.\", \"One thing you didn\\'t mention was the woodworking shop that we\\'ve talked about in the past is that has that been?Kinda Okay, well as we\\'ve talked about in the past, it\\'s really difficult to get started on some things that we\\'ve avoided for quite some time.\", \"So, like in the past, let\\'s brainstorm.\", \"Try to figure out how we can get some some movement in the woodworking shops.\", \"That sound good.\", \"Sure.\", \"Okay, so so one thing we\\'ve discussed in the past, Charles is extremely important is what you\\'re thinking about as you\\'re going into the woodworking shop.\", \"So, what are your thoughts?\", \"When you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop?\", \"What do you think?Okay, so let\\'s explore that.\", \"So.\", \"So what\\'s the evidence that it\\'s hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop?Okay, so it sounds like you\\'re saying then it\\'s disorganized.\", \"And it\\'s a mess.\", \"So how do you feel when you think about the woodworking shop that way?Okay.\", \"So it prevents you from actually getting things done is what you\\'re saying?\", \"Yes.\", \"Okay.\", \"Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way to Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I\\'m probably They\\'re not gonna do anything, which makes sense.\", \"So, so what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop?\", \"That would actually be helpful?\", \"What\\'s another way?Okay, that\\'s a really good start.Okay?\", \"And what would that lead to?\", \"If you get those things built?\", \"What would you have to do anything with those things?So it sounds like there\\'s a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids so you\\'d be able to see them and spend time with with them, you\\'d feel better about going to do that.\", \"But you\\'d also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that basically what you\\'re saying would Yeah, okay, sure.\", \"But as we\\'ve talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there.\", \"Right?\", \"That wouldn\\'t change overnight.\", \"So I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids.\", \"So how about we talked about the first step, which sounds like would be to just move things off one bench?\", \"Does that sound right?Okay.\", \"That sounds great.So let\\'s talk about that.\", \"Then let\\'s let\\'s sketch out what each day would look like so that we won\\'t won\\'t feel overwhelmed like we did in the past.\", \"So let\\'s talk about each day and how we would sketch out each day Does that sound good?Jackie, how are you?thanks for asking.\", \"I see that you have signed a release so I could talk to your mother and that she brought you in today.\", \"What\\'s What\\'s going on there?your family thinks show drinking problem.So they asked you to come into the agency.Do you believe that you have a drinking problem?You think It\\'s okay?Come on, you mind if I ask you a few questions related to drinking,So, how often do you drink now?What about on the weekend?How much you\\'re drinking, let\\'s say on the weekendAll right, how about during the week?Are you drinking More than you want to?So, so you\\'ve tried to cut down before?Do you have cravings for alcohol?So are you using exclusively alcohol or are there other drugs involved?when was the last time you\\'re impatient?four or five months ago?\", \"And at that time you use cocaine.And why did you stop using cocaine?You crave cocaine?how about Your work are you having a trouble keeping your job or your performance your job?any social problems because of the alcohol use?you have some social problems.\", \"Not so much with your friends a little bit but more with your familyHave you found that you\\'re engaging in any activities are physically dangerous because of alcohol?Do you find that you have any exacerbation of symptoms you have already?\", \"Like any medical or mental health problems made worse by the alcohol?So did you notice the point after you started drinking when you had to increase the amount that you\\'re trying to get the same effect?When did that happen?When was the last time you noticed that when you had to drink a lot more to get the same effect.How about withdraw?\", \"Do you have any symptoms of withdrawal when you stop drinking?\", \"Like physical symptoms anxiety?Ok, Jackie, are you open to seeing a counselor here at the agency?So you are not sure what to try it out.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I\\'ll get you scheduled to see a counselor.\", \"I want to thank you for telling me about what\\'s going on and for answering my questions.\", \"It\\'s been helpful.Jason, I don\\'t want to be hereyou\\'re good?Do you know what you\\'re charged with?The government.\", \"Do you have anyone specific?How long have they been wanting to do this to you?always there?Even taking medications.Do you know what they want to do with that information?So what can you do in a situation?\", \"Well, you said the government\\'s monitoring everything and they want to put you in jail.\",

think about what those are from and maybe they\\'re from dog poop and that\\'s going to get on you.\", \"And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar.\", \"And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel like it\\'s just running up your arm through your bloodstream.\", \"And you keep thinking oh my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there\\'s some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house.\", \"Take the leash off.\", \"And the urge to wash is so powerful, so strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash.\", \"But you don\\'t do that.\", \"You know, to make yourself not do the ritual.\", \"And then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that\\'s the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what\\'s going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash.\", \"At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened.\", \"Wake up in the morning.\", \"And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you\\'re sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right.\", \"You\\'re sick.\", \"And you know, it\\'s because you handled that lesion didn\\'t wash, you didn\\'t do the washing you needed to do.\", \"And now you\\'re sick and the baby will probably get sick.\", \"And if only you had done the washing, okay?\", \"What\\'s

scoring are that you\\'ve increased your weight at a pace that\\'s a little faster than What normally happens and with it waves, intended notice that because we sleep at night, the extra weights they put on, can actually help and can push your tongue backwards and sort of covering one pipe and then it creates snoring that you\\'ve been having.\", \"So, if you could imagine you\\'re laying down like this.\", \"Okay?\", \"And here\\'s your nose and this is where the airflow comes in, to windpipe, okay, here\\'s your mouth, and your tongue just sits like that.\", \"Now, sometimes what can happen is that the time So down here in this area that can actually stop the airflow here.\", \"So what happens during this reaction to try and get oxygen in?\", \"Okay?\", \"For this, I would like to run a couple tests to do bottom of it.\", \"I will be advising you to go for a sleep study.\", \"And I can measure how well you\\'re sleeping and delineates what\\'s happening, what\\'s causing the snoring.\", \"Your heart sounds sound good.\", \"And because I think it\\'s, it\\'s possible that you may have to also have a heart condition that\\'s related to it.\", \"I would like to get an ECG.I think they are related Oh, and then regarding the increase in weight, I can advise you to eat a low fat low cholesterol diet.\", \"I\\'d like you to increase your exercise to five times a week for about 30 minutes and I would like to order some bloodwork because you haven\\'t had your physical in a while no include your blood sugar, your cholesterol, and electrolytes and such.\", \"Okay.\", \"Do you have any other questions for me?Is snoring awful tired, trouble sleeping at night risk factors are decreased oxygenation because of the breathing.So now as you kind of take a emotional

still there.\", \"Three is still suffering, but not as much as before.\", \"And not nearly as much as the peak.\", \"Do you think going forward, you can apply this self talk in the morning, when that

to put too much on you at one time.\", \"So I\\'m kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it.\", \"Okay?\", \"And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do.\", \"Okay.\", \"So, I\\'d like that to be one of the, you know, if you\\'re okay with it, that\\'d be one homework steps, and the other one.\", \"So just just be two things for this week.\", \"So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you\\'re having these automatic thoughts.\", \"So these automatic thoughts proceed.\", \"feelings, and behaviors that you don\\'t like, like feeling worried.\", \"So they\\'re a little hard to pick up at first, because you\\'re already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense.\", \"And there\\'s a few steps But you\\'re already having the feeling of worry.\", \"And now I\\'m asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So that\\'s not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that.\", \"If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it\\'s safe to do so.\", \"And if you can\\'t, okay.\", \"So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried.\", \"And then you think back to what was going through your mind.\", \"And you find it was worrying about the

well.Good question.\", \"I would say keep in touch.\", \"journal, okay, and bring it in.\", \"To the extent you\\'re comfortable talking about, we can go over.\", \"Okay.\", \"And we\\'ll try to together develop self talk to address that.\", \"Okay.\", \"So we\\'re going to build, we\\'re going to build an inventory of adaptive responses.\", \"Okay.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about?I think that would be a great start.\", \"And we\\'ll set up a time for down here for another point for next week.\", \"We\\'ll get that all situated.\", \"But I want to Close just by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session.\", \"Okay.\", \"I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding

positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you\\'ll be stronger as a result of working to overcome.\", \"Does that resonate with you?\", \"How do you think of yourself?Yeah, so I hope that you\\'ll be able to overcome what\\'s going on now.\", \"But also build a skill set that you can use to overcome new challenges, because you\\'ll face new ones.\", \"And I want you to be the most prepared you can be I feel like even though you have these worries and anxieties, I want I\\'d like you to remember you have a lot of strengths.\", \"I feel

hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you\\'re partying with?Well, there\\'s a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren\\'t a good choice, right?\", \"That\\'s some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what\\'s best for you.\", \"And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.I think youreally need to quit.I think you\\'re wrong.\", \"You know, it really worries me.\", \"Anyway, I wish you would quit.\", \"If all you\\'re gonna

\"Where do you think you should kind of go from here?\", \"YeahUmmYour mom is really important to you ?how confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or even cut down or quit?especially on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all and 10 is completely what number ?Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?Umm hmmRight?\", \"What do you think\\'s a realistic goal for you then?Okayyour goals to not drink at all, or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very moment.Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this.\", \"I know it seems like something that\\'s been on your mind as it is.\", \"And, you know, like I said, I really care about you, as a student and an athlete and want what\\'s best for you.\", \"So I\\'m glad we were able to talk about this, it really seems like you have a good plan going forward.\", \"You know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all.\", \"And if you find yourself in a situation where there\\'s alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum.\", \"Sounds like something that\\'ll work for you.Yeah, it\\'s my pleasure.\", \"It\\'s part of my job and part I like best so we better hurry up and get changed for practice.\", \"All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director, it\\'s my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone\\'s adhering to that rule and I\\'ve been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend, and from what I hear while you were there, and you know, I can\\'t confirm or deny anything.\", \"So I\\'m not at the point where I can give you consequences.\", \"But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you\\'re drinking and how, you know, you really can\\'t be doing this as a member of one of our teams.Oh, yeah, I get it.\", \"Like, we\\'ve all been there.\", \"Okay.\",

diary card that you have that you did cut.Okay, so let\\'s talk about that a little bit.\", \"When what day did that happen on?\", \"Tuesday?\", \"Okay, so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut?What was going on at your locker?Okay, so you were sending out your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn\\'t want to hear.\", \"What were you feeling right then?on a scale of one to 10  how angry would you say you were ?pretty angry then?What did you do right then?\", \"You ride your locker.\", \"What\\'s the next thing you did after you heard it?So I know that the gym is usually to the place where you cut, because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don\\'t usually see you there.Okay, so we\\'re between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym.\", \"Where did you decide to cut?\", \"Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody.\", \"There must have been a point where you decided I\\'m going to cut.Okay, so that was when you decided to cut.\", \"You went down to the gym.\", \"And what happened when you got there?What did you use to cut ?the same pencil as usual?the the metal tip.Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of.Okay, so you still have the pencil you got under the bleachers.\", \"You say you were feeling angry still.\", \"Are you still on the scale of one to 10 where were you when you got under the bleachers.Okay, what were you thinking at that point?So you have your pencil Where did you cut ?How many times ?How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid?But it wasn\\'t so deep that you needed something more?Okay.\", \"Right after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger?three, what were you thinking right afterwards?Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?Okay, so that\\'s what happened right afterwards ?\", \"Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting?Okay.I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?Sounds like you weren\\'t feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon.Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn\\'t last?I knew you\\'ve also been working on doing less cutting.you have you\\'ve been working really hard.\", \"I\\'m just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won\\'t have those guilty feelings?Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker.\", \"what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.Okay, it sounds like you\\'re also already having a pretty bad day.\", \"You said he hadn\\'t called.\", \"He hadn\\'t been texting us.\", \"And that was on your mind?So I\\'m wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.that\\'ll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit.It might not.\", \"But it\\'ll bring it down a little bit.\", \"Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more.maybe there\\'ll be things will feel good about later.\", \"You won\\'t have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back.So the first thing is that pencil, it sounds like it\\'s comforting to have it.\", \"It also sounds like it\\'s tempting, What do you think about that?having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things.\", \"When you\\'ve been talking about how you\\'re really committed to not cutting any more or cutting lessSounds like that pencils standing in your way.What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time, choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you can\\'t cut with.\", \"That way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won\\'t tempt you.\", \"That\\'ll make it easier to try the two things.Okay, what do you think our first thing should be?\", \"What do you think you can try?\", \"You just heard somebody say something you don\\'t want to hear you\\'re feeling pretty angry.\", \"What can you do in that moment?Do you have your headphones with you at  school?Is that something you\\'d be willing to try next time?Okay, that sounds like a good one to try.\", \"So we have headphones, we need to come up with One more.\", \"What do you think you\\'d like to try?That sounds like a good option.\", \"That\\'s our goal is to keep pushing, cutting further down the list, and keep adding things that you\\'re going to try first.\", \"And you\\'re right that the first thing you try, it might not bring you all the way down to a two or three, but it might bring you down a little bit.\", \"And each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more.\", \"So you have to be willing to try a few things.\", \"Can you do that?I think that\\'s a good idea.Okay.\", \"Thank you for answering all my questions on this.\", \"You did a great job with this chain and I know it wasn\\'t easy.Let\\'s go look for a pencil.Hi, August I\\'m Angie.\", \"I\\'m one of the nurses here.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, I\\'m sorry to hear that.\", \"When you\\'re sad what helps you feel better?okay.\", \"What else helps you feel better?\", \"I see you have a phone there.\", \"Do you play any games on that?Okay, well, why don\\'t you play one of your games that might help you feel better and I\\'m gonna go and come back in a few minutes.\", \"Okay?Okay, that\\'s good.\", \"August, you feeling better now?\", \"Good.\", \"Okay, that\\'s really good.\", \"And this time when you go back home, when you go home, can you talk to your group home worker, let him or her know that you\\'ve been here again, and that you were feeling sad again.\", \"Okay, great.\", \"I\\'m gonna go get the doctor.\", \"Elizabeth, how you doing today?How things been going since the last time we met?Okay, so there\\'s a few things going on there.\", \"You said you feeling stuck?\", \"Not happy.\", \"And some sound like a little confused as to what\\'s going on what\\'s causing it.\", \"You have any suspicions about what might be causing?And how long have you been?\", \"You say housewife, right?\", \"How long, you\\'ve been the housewife?something\\'s changed.\", \"So for a long time, you were satisfied in housewife, you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life.\", \"And somewhere along the line, something changed in you.\", \"And now you\\'re not happy with it.\", \"So what it represents in terms of activities like caring for your children and shopping?\", \"No, that\\'s what changed.So you\\'re, you\\'re frustrated with your situation, maybe with yourself a little bit.You\\'re not motivated?Have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning?\", \"Has anyone else noticed that you\\'re down?they used the word lazy.Okay, that was painful for you.\", \"What about what your husband said?\", \"What was your response to that?\", \"When I said, I need you to more?Okay, so you\\'re frustrated forfeeling down?\", \"And you\\'re frustrated for lacking motivation?And just as little as a few years ago, you didn\\'t feel it this way at all?Okay, so I\\'m gonna shift gears a little bit.\", \"Can you tell me about your well, a recent day?\", \"So it\\'s kind of typical what you\\'re telling me now meaning not motivated down?This is you said this was recently right?What would the ideal day of look like take that same day and do you wish you could have done?Alright, so it\\'s a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior and where you want to be.\", \"So let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day you would mention that when it was time to get up.\", \"Right?\", \"You did.\", \"So you were awake and aware of it, but you went back to sleep.\", \"And, of course, your husband got up and he took care of things.\", \"How did you feel alone Not to happen, because clearly that\\'s not what you want to happen.\", \"How did you feel about oversleeping?Okay, so I\\'m not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought, which was, if I\\'m not mistaken, you said what\\'s the point, can you expand on that?What\\'s the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back?Okay.\", \"But then, when you when you do get up, you feel sad and guilty about having overslept.So really, functionally, what you\\'re doing is you\\'re delaying experiencing the pain.And then in terms of how it affects your relationships and your family, you\\'re not getting your kids off to school.\", \"Your husband\\'s getting real frustrated.\", \"And all you\\'ve really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep.\", \"And you know, presumably without without pain because you\\'re sleeping, but you\\'re not really escaping it.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school?So maybe what\\'s going on here?\", \"Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we\\'ve talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I\\'ll be using and different things we\\'re talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that\\'s useful, which in this case, I\\'m assuming we can agree is the getting up on time.\", \"behavior that\\'s useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn\\'t match.\", \"Right.\", \"So sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems.\", \"If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right?\", \"Because that\\'s why you\\'re over sleeping, as you\\'re sleeping longer to avoid that.\", \"But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed.\", \"So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate.\", \"Because functionally speaking, you\\'re completing the tasks that you want.\", \"What\\'s tough about that, So in the moment, it\\'s easy for me to say this now.\", \"But in the moment, like for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you\\'re going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later.\", \"So in that moment, it\\'s hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards.\", \"I mean, it sounds like you want to get up and Well, it seems like you\\'re, you\\'re more or less making things worse, right?\", \"In an effort to avoid the pain that you\\'re going to suffer anyway.\", \"You\\'re making the pain worse, and just delaying it a little bit, right.\", \"What what thought and we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless.\", \"Right, and I\\'m going to expand on my thought a little and say that, you know that thoughts really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer.\", \"That\\'s a version of the thought.Okay.\", \"So minimizing the benefit.So there\\'s a couple of things going on, right?\", \"I can avoid the pain by slipping in.\", \"And there\\'s really no point to getting out because I won\\'t do any good anyway.\", \"What adaptive response is that self talk, we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when you\\'re, you know, whatever time you get up in the morning, when you\\'re thinking about this, that thought comes in that it doesn\\'t really matter if I get up anyway.Okay.\", \"So that would be adaptive response.\", \"I\\'m strong enough.\", \"I can get through this, but it will be difficult.\", \"Right?\", \"How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school.\", \"The automatic thought right now is telling you that\\'s not valuable.\", \"But I think that you believe it is valuable.it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back.\", \"If you do get up, then if you guess that\\'s true, right?\", \"she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do.That kind of makes sense?So even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem like not a practical move.\", \"Logically, you know, that has a better chance of paying off for you and I think that with with these type of, what you\\'re going through is probably depression.\", \"Right now what I like to talk to you further, to make sure that\\'s what\\'s going on seems like you\\'re depressed, and sometimes with depression, you just have to get one thing going your way each day.\", \"Right?\", \"So, so I\\'m not saying necessarily tomorrow, you have to get up one time, and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right?\", \"You don\\'t have to build Rome in a day here.\", \"Right?\", \"It\\'s, it\\'s more like, Can I do this one thing?\", \"Okay, I proved to myself, just what I\\'m saying, which is I\\'m strong enough to get up.\", \"See the kids often have that one victory for tomorrow.\", \"Right and build on that.\", \"And part of that\\'s going to be playing those adaptive responses back, right thinking of those thoughts.\", \"Whether it\\'s just thinking them, you know, in your mind or actually thinking them and saying, sometimes it\\'s helpful just to say them out loud,So you have a good handle on the adaptive responses sounds like right.\", \"And you know what you have to say after but you know, what you want to do.\", \"I\\'ll see again in a week, and there\\'ll be five days in there between now and my see again, we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not, right.\", \"So I want you to give that a tryto adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior.\", \"Now it\\'s important to keep in mind that we have five days between now I want to see you again in five business days, right?\", \"school days, and you may not succeed every day.\", \"And that\\'s okay.\", \"Right?Sometimes the setbacks like you could, you could get up early two days in a row and then it goes up back up third day, don\\'t let that will wash away those successes.\", \"It\\'s a day by day fight, try not to think of it in terms of the week, I want you to try to think of it in terms of what I have to do today.\", \"Not worrying about the future, and not worrying about should done in the past.\", \"The only moment we really can live in is now.\", \"So try to stay in present the moment recite those adaptive responses, and try to push for that just that one victory.\", \"Okay, can you try that?All right.\", \"So work on that and To continue with the homework, that maybe the CBT homework haven\\'t given you and I\\'ll see you next week.\", \"ThanksHi, Gabriela, I understand that you\\'re here today because you\\'ve been experiencing some low mood.So it sounds like you\\'ve been experiencing some low mood and you\\'re kind of struggling to get going a bit.You\\'ve had low mood in the past, but it\\'s kind of you\\'ve been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently, you found that harder.\", \"Okay, so I understand that you you first went to your GP he referred you here about two months ago.\", \"And can I ask what what led you to go to the GP in the first place?Okay, so it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren\\'t expecting it.\", \"So kind of came out of the blue a bit and, and that you\\'ve been on your own quite a lot.\", \"So you\\'re not been seeing people as much and it sounds like your mom, notice that there\\'s been a bit of a change in you.\", \"Okay, and how things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP?Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?\", \"Okay, so you feel like it\\'s kind of odd or unusual to be here, coming to see a clinical psychologist, I suppose I just want to reassure you that it\\'s absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety.\", \"It\\'s really very common, and it certainly isn\\'t auto strange at all.\", \"So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today.\", \"So what I guess led you to do that because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you\\'ve managed to come anyway.\", \"So sounds like partly you\\'re doing it then your mum because you\\'re a bit worried that she she isn\\'t pleased with you at the moment.Okay.\", \"And I think it\\'s great that you\\'ve come here.\", \"And definitely there\\'s a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression and particularly the type of therapy that we\\'re going to be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy.\", \"And I\\'ll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I\\'m just trying to find out a bit more about you today.\", \"So I saw from your notes that your medic studentokay, so I guess what, why, what\\'s, what\\'s the reason that you\\'re not in uni this year?Okay, so just thinking that would be about six months ago was it that your ear out started, and it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough.And you\\'re planning on the panning on returning.don\\'t sound too sure about that though?Okay, so it doesn\\'t, it doesn\\'t sound like you want to go back.Okay, so I guess in there\\'s quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment.\", \"And I\\'m just wondering In the meantime, what are you what are you up to what have you been doing?Okay, how many shifts have you done there?okay.\", \"How when was that shift?Okay, and how was it, I suppose I\\'m intrigued.\", \"Can you tell me a bit more about that?\", \"So it sounds like you quite enjoyed that then?And what makes you think you weren\\'t very good?So the person who owns the restaurant is your mom\\'s friend.Okay, so it says you\\'re saying that you think you weren\\'t very good that\\'s because you\\'re a bit slow and you got confused with some orders.\", \"Is it?\", \"You said it\\'s common for people to do that.\", \"Well, on that first shift, that\\'s a she said toes,Okay, so I\\'ve just been noting down some of those thoughts that you\\'ve been having.\", \"You kind of So you feel like you\\'re not very good, you\\'re slow.\", \"You\\'re confused with the orders and you feel like you\\'re inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you.\", \"And I suppose I\\'m wondering I mean what makes you think that she feels sorry for you?When you\\'re having these kind of thoughts, because that\\'s quite a lot of negative thoughts you\\'re describing how do you feel?so it sounds like you feel like these thoughts are very true then.\", \"I mean, if you\\'re going to write them, so I\\'m going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe.\", \"You said, I\\'m not very good and I\\'m inconveniencing them.\", \"How much would you say you believe those on a scale out of 100?\", \"where 100 is like I absolutely believe it and zeros like I don\\'t believe it at all.so you feel quite sure that you definitely believe okay.\", \"And you said that when you\\'re thinking those thoughts, she started to feel quite empty.there any other emotions that you experience?Okay, so you feel empty distance you feel drained and how when you\\'re feeling these emotions, how do you feel in your body?\", \"Kind of what sensations do you notice?Did you have butterflies that night when you\\'re at the restaurant?Okay, and when you When you have these emotions, how does it affect your energy levels?\", \"Do you feel more energetic, less energetic or about the same?Yeah.\", \"And when you\\'re having those emotions that you were describingYeah, sounds like you feel very tired.\", \"You\\'re struggling to wake up.\", \"You said it\\'s pointless.\", \"And then what do you do then when you feel like that?\", \"So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning, and you feel heavy, and I suppose you\\'ve been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions, potentially the night before?\", \"What do you then do?\", \"How do you respond to that?So you\\'re a bit slower and gets getting up.But you are still getting up anyway.\", \"And what about your kind of what do you think about when you\\'re doing that?So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about hey, how can it hapen to me?Okay, so it sounds like you try and toughen up on yourself a little bit.\", \"Tell yourself to work harder to be different.\", \"Okay.\", \"And when you start telling yourself that kind of thing and how does that make you feel?\", \"Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse?Hi ChrisThanks for coming in today and filling out our survey.\", \"I wonder if it\\'s okay, If I go over a couple of the things that that you answered in the survey?\", \"Okay.\", \"One of the things that that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right now.And I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas, and I wondered what what your thoughts are about using condoms?You\\'ve heard a lot of negative things about condom usage.Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"So Chris, it\\'s okay if I share with you some of the things that I\\'ve learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage.\", \"Okay.\", \"What some people don\\'t realize and don\\'t know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy, but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like Flaminia along with HIV.\", \"They\\'re really effective in preventing these things.\", \"And there\\'s also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don\\'t know, the local health departments have condoms and many times they\\'re free.\", \"And local pharmacies, drug stores have condoms.\", \"And there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they\\'re actually free.\", \"And there\\'s some some ways to that people have found carrying them around pretty conveniently, you know, in their car or in their pockets because they\\'re pretty small.\", \"What does it sound like?\", \"As I\\'m talking what what are what are some thoughts that are going, going through your mind?Okay.\", \"Yeah.\", \"You\\'re not interested in becoming a father right now I\\'m guessing.Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Great.\", \"Well, can I ask you?\", \"So after this conversation today on a scale of zero to 10, with zero being that it\\'s not at all important to you and 10 being that it\\'s extremely important?\", \"Where do you think you fall with how important you know taking a chance on using condoms would be to you now?Okay.\", \"Okay, well, that\\'s great.\", \"It sounds like you really have have, you know a plan in mind?\", \"What do you think you\\'ll do next Like what do you think would be a next step with you as far as contraception or condoms?Okay, well, we\\'ve got some here at the clinic.\", \"Would you like me to give you some on your way out?And you can just take them with you.Great.\", \"Well, thank you so much for talking with me today, Chris.\", \"It was nice to meet you.Come in.\", \"This is awesome.How are you today?You came in to see one of my colleagues recently didn\\'t you.And she sent you for a blood test.Yeah, we think he might be anemic.\", \"What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result.\", \"And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments.\", \"Does that sound okay with you?Great.\", \"So should we have a look at your blood test?\", \"Yes.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Here it is.\", \"So what we\\'re testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, right and just to show you the normal range for Women is between 11.5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right?\", \"And this is your level of hemoglobin.\", \"It\\'s 8.7.\", \"It\\'s a bit lower than we would like.\", \"So what we\\'re looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right.\", \"Just  to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you\\'ve got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia.\", \"And it\\'s very treatable as well.\", \"Yeah.I must be, because you\\'ve got quite a busy lifestyle.Okay.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Shall I tell you a bit more about anemia?\", \"Do you know anything about the condition?It is the condition relates to your blood right.\", \"Within your blood there\\'s several components, one of which is plasma.\", \"Within the plasma you have your red blood cells.\", \"And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs.\", \"Okay?\", \"Now if that\\'s not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you\\'ve been having like breathlessness.\", \"dizziness, tiredness.One of the causes can be blood loss.\", \"So I wondered about your periods.\", \"How are they?Yeah, that may be a fact.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So I want to talk to you about treatments.\", \"Now.\", \"There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try.\", \"The first thing we\\'d like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet.\", \"Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?teenage children they keep you busy.It must be hard for you to do all those things.yeah.\", \"Now you mentioned ready meals.\", \"I can understand you relying on those for convenience.\", \"But the problem is sometimes you don\\'t get the proper balance of nutrients.So what I\\'d ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you\\'re a vegetarian.You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat.Yeah, exactly.\", \"Also liver is a good source of iron.\", \"What about something like steak that you mentioned?\", \"Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly?There\\'s also leafy green vegetables, things like kale and spinach, a good source of iron.\", \"Yes.\", \"Yeah, I like broccoli.\", \"You know, There\\'s other things too.\", \"You might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron.\", \"AndWell, if you look on the ingredients, panel, cereals, you\\'ll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those.\", \"could make your life a bit easier.white bread is a good source of iron as well.So do you think you could give some of those things a try?right.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s the other thing I\\'d like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets.Okay.\", \"This can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia.\", \"And what it does is it supplements the amount of iron and iron you\\'re getting in your diet.yes, yes.\", \"Often people respond very well to those.\", \"You can have some side effects.\", \"Sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on, you know, on an empty stomach.\", \"So Do you take them after a meal?I think those two things adapting your diet and taking a course of iron tablets, I think he might respond very well to treatment.\", \"how do you feel about the information I\\'ve given you so far outside?Yes.\", \"Excellent.\", \"Yeah, excellent.\", \"I\\'ve given you quite a lot of information about anemia today.\", \"I\\'ve got a leaflet here about anemia, which I thought you might like to take home and read in your own time.\", \"That\\'s right.That\\'s right.\", \"So just to check that I\\'ve explained things to you correctly, that you could just recap on the the two treatments that you\\'re going to tryYeah.Yes, excellent.\", \"So what I\\'d like you to do is come back in a couple of weeks, and then we can see how you\\'re doing.\", \"Have you got any questions?I think at this stage, when you come back to see me again, we\\'ll do another blood test and check on your hemoglobin level than if you haven\\'t, if it hasn\\'t gone back into the normal range.\", \"It might be then that we look at doing some other investigations.\", \"But I don\\'t want to worry about that.\", \"At this stage.\", \"I think let\\'s see how you do with the dietary change in the iron tablets.\", \"And we can discuss that next time.Is there anything else?Okay.\", \"Well, good to see you.\", \"And I\\'ll see you again in a few weeks.ByeTim, what\\'s hard I mean, how does your body feel when you think about showing him that that vulnerable side of you?\", \"Can you feel that in your body?\", \"How does that feel?Is it?RightAh, that\\'s just so so so there\\'s a sadness here, when your partner says, I don\\'t really see, you don\\'t really show me that softer part of you, there\\'s a sadness there and it feels like a stone in your stomach, right?\", \"But somehow you helped me it\\'s like, what I\\'m hearing is for you to actually touch that vulnerability and show him there\\'s something about not being capable, they\\'re not being strong.\", \"Is that it?It\\'s difficult for all of us here to give that up.\", \"It\\'s difficult for all of us.\", \"Right?And we all have that sense of needing to protect ourselves.\", \"Right?\", \"And I think what you guys are telling me, I mean, we go back and talk about your relationships, in your past relationships, we\\'ve often learned that it\\'s very bad idea to be vulnerable.\", \"We\\'re talking about that you guys are also in a cultural context where that\\'s not encouraged to be vulnerable.you\\'ve been together for a long time, and so you\\'re Is that what you mean?\", \"No, I mean, being gay.\", \"That\\'s, yeah, yeah.\", \"Yes.\", \"You\\'re even more vulnerable, gay.\", \"There\\'s a vulnerability about being gay.\", \"Period.\", \"Exactly.\", \"So there\\'s an even you need to protect Yeah, I validate and normalize their need to protect themselves as individuals and gay men in a heterosexual world.\", \"Hello, Susan.\", \"Good to See you today.\", \"So, tell me what brings you here?Okay, so tell me what that looks like.was anything physical thought there?Do you remember what thoughts going on?Four is it worth once you go through?So sounds like you might need to find something that helps.Would you like to describe that?Well, there\\'s something called grounding do you know?So with grounding, a lot of people have a lot of emotions, okay to have emotions, but for some people, it gets really intense like, a lot and no one wants to bring that down to more of a calm place.\", \"So it doesn\\'t necessarily solve the problem like there\\'s still traffic.\", \"Yeah, nothing\\'s going on, which just helps you get to a place to deal withSo I\\'m going to introduce a grounding technique to you, okay, and involves some deeper events in closing the eyes and getting to your senses.\", \"Okay, so I have a little script.\", \"OkayThey\\'ll tell me after.\", \"I\\'d be like, okay,But somebody gave me I just want to know relax, comfortable, comfortable resting Hands on your side whatever was working for you pretty good.\", \"I don\\'t want you to disappoint, Chest rises, So don\\'t worry about it.\", \"Just okay what is comfortable now we\\'re gonna gauge and use in each of the five senses.\", \"And so for that I want you to, close your eyes, I want You to listen to my voice read my instructions So let\\'s begin to relax by just noticing all the sounds around to start with.\", \"for the constant noise?notice the sound before like that?let\\'s move on to smell  do you smelling anything?Now to open up about site, so I\\'m just listening something so as you can see in this one right now you picture right there dear or whatever it is.\", \"What about the colors of what you see on?Yeah, when he first came here Did you notice ?And so maxwidth taste Notice I can just tell you some other situation you can take the time to like snack or something.\", \"Talk about the taste the texture.\", \"Well, it\\'s totally the food and feel.\", \"Okay?You can still do even without food just simply face enough saliva.\", \"Okay?something new this morning?And then finally we\\'ll touch on science.\", \"So when you hands on right now?describe to me how it feels?So what we\\'re just able to just went through each of the senses as a way of a bit of extraction from here.\", \"This also can be called a lying down to the details and then something else at the end, you can say, So, how does that feel?Was there a certain sense that you weren\\'t most help?So let\\'s talk about how we can use this because obviously can\\'t close your eyes, right?\", \"So what can you do I drive sensors can be used?Do you have any kind of peacefulness?Yeah, yeah.Yeah, I\\'m focusing on the car in front of youlet\\'s think about when So what sensors.\", \"Can we tap into?The hearing?So not too much about the function of things like when you have to type on the keyboard you knowOkay.\", \"So the next time when you try to tap into the census, okay?\", \"If you want to take just a five minute break and so for each sense that a one minute okay, like before I start the test or before I start to drive or something Okay, okay to kind of do that.And also your statement.\", \"Okay.Okay, so when you will do this?you know, before we even we, yeah, so when you\\'re sitting?Okay.\", \"So that\\'s okay.See how it goes?\", \"We\\'ll talk about it.Okay, because the situation right now.\", \"Don\\'t try to focus too much on.\", \"Okay?\", \"make you aware of your surroundings, okay.\", \"Okay.All right.\", \"Well, thanks for that.\", \"Hi.\", \"Alvina, how are you doing today?\", \"It\\'s good to see you?just tired?you know, we did some pre visit planning with you and your Ph.\", \"Q two, which is a short depression screen was actually positive.\", \"So we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool, which is a pH q nine.\", \"And that actually did come up with a score of eight, which is in mild depression range.\", \"So how does that How does that feel?But you knew something was something was wrong.Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself.So you sleep a lot.\", \"But even though you\\'re sleeping you don\\'t wake up rested.Doesn\\'t sound like good quality sleep.How long has that been going on?Two or three months?What else is going on?And that\\'s where its increased?And I can see where that would be bothersome to you.\", \"What else?\", \"What else is going on with you?And anniversaries is close?That\\'s particularly hard.\", \"When those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents.\", \"that\\'s a that\\'s a very difficult time.Kind of a hole in your life?I\\'m really sorry for your loss.\", \"And thank you for sharing that with me.\", \"I know that\\'s, I know, that\\'s very difficult.\", \"So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected.\", \"You\\'re not getting good quality sleep.\", \"You\\'re really fatigued.\", \"just kind of going through the motions.\", \"It sounds like during the day And then how\\'s your appetite then?So you used to be more socially involved than you aren\\'t now.A little more isolated.So if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?kind of feels like you\\'re stuck at this point.I wonder if it would be okay, if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression like you would that be right?\", \"Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer.\", \"So, no medication at this point.\", \"All right.\", \"Then, I think as important, certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling, and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and, and getting some feedback on that.\", \"so that was a pretty good experience?Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate.\", \"And those that some it\\'s another thing that we could talk about if you want to learn a little bit more about those.Okay.\", \"If it\\'s okay, let\\'s go back to talking about the counseling for a minute.\", \"And then we can hit some of those Other things, too.\", \"So is there a counselor that you know, or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom\\'s death?\", \"Is she someone that\\'s out in the community?\", \"So it sounds like you\\'re pretty ready to do that.\", \"Could you say on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being really ready, zero being not ready at all.\", \"How ready would you be to do some counseling?Six or seven?\", \"Why a six or seven and not a four or five?So it sounds like you\\'ve got a connection there already.\", \"That\\'s really good.\", \"Does that sound like something you\\'re ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?Well, that\\'s okay.\", \"Then it would it be alright, if we talked a little bit about the exercise?\", \"I know you.\", \"So that didn\\'t really sound like an option for you at this time and that\\'s perfectly fine.\", \"Only you can make those decisions Alvina.\", \"But if it\\'s okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.Exercises is again in a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants.Yeah, it actually raises serotonin You heard about serotonin.\", \"Happy hormone.\", \"Yes.\", \"So it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF, which is, well, it doesn\\'t really matter what it is, but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself.\", \"So exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly in and actually improving the quality of sleep.\", \"How does that sound at this point?Absolutely.\", \"Again, those are yours, your decisions and I\\'m, I\\'m here to really support you in those if those sound like things that you might be willing to do, I\\'m, I\\'m all for it.So you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Is this something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group?So it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do.Which of those tend to interest you most?Very good.\", \"Well, I think it sounds like this is an important for you to feel better.\", \"And it sounds like you\\'re really ready to kind of make a plan.\", \"How do you see this fitting into your Life at this pointagain, kind of getting back to the counseling and, and the exercise.Let\\'s talk a little bit more about that Your say on a scale, if we can do another one of those scales, zero being confident that you could start an exercise program.\", \"Zero being not very competent at all and 10 being very confident.\", \"Tell me where you are in this exercise thing.That sounds like a pretty strong commitment.Okay.\", \"And tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point, then.I think that\\'s a great decision.\", \"You have a couple of friends in mind that you could call.So tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise.So it would be difficult to do it in the morning.\", \"You don\\'t see that happeningDo you think it would be easier to do it after work?come home its over?All right.\", \"Well, good.\", \"It sounds like we have a plan for the counselor.\", \"And when you check out today, I\\'ll put this in your record.\", \"And that will want to get in touch with the counselor that you work with when your mom was going through.\", \"her passing in the grief situation and then I\\'ll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program.Alright.\", \"And if it\\'s okay, I\\'d like to call you in a week to one, see how you\\'re feeling and two, if the exercise is helping, you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial, you may actually look forward to it.\", \"Because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood.\", \"And then I would also like to see you back in two weeks, just to check on things now.\", \"We\\'ve talked about exercise department, we\\'ve talked about medication not being on the table at this point.\", \"But I want you to know, you know, you can call anytime, and I will work to get you in.\", \"And that might be something that we need to do if if our plan is not working.\", \"You okay now kind of taking a look at some of your thinking and situation from that point of view, okay.\", \"Some things kind of stand out for me and hearing you talk about what\\'s been happening and your feelings I can appreciate.\", \"It\\'s really painful.\", \"And I would say to the reader that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts.\", \"I think that you\\'ll see it\\'s it\\'s helpful although I know It\\'s a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes.\", \"But I\\'d like to try to kind of distinguish between the two.\", \"Okay.\", \"You said that you\\'ve been at your job for about five years.\", \"You really like your job.\", \"So tell me about your job, like kind of how you felt about it, but frame it in a time before this ever happened.So you remember accomplishing things at that job that you felt benefits society, the people you help.You kept people safe.\", \"And you had a lot of satisfaction from the work you did.\", \"And now doesn\\'t feel that way?When you described it, it almost sounds like you talked about how you\\'re afraid of making a mistake.\", \"You\\'re thinking about yourself in a way where you\\'re almost risk.Your your work right now even though you have this one, situations extremely stressful and hard on you.\", \"You have other families that you interact with now to you tell me about those interactions.So this is maybe what\\'s different.\", \"This what you\\'re saying from before till now?\", \"Is decisions seemed clear cut.All right.\", \"So you\\'re looking inward, you\\'re looking at yourself a lot of self doubt.\", \"Now you\\'re looking at decisions as much more difficult.\", \"It\\'s much more difficult to come to the right decision.\", \"And second guessing sounds like move to second guessing a bit.\", \"When you do make a decision, like playing over over your mind.\", \"What could go wrong here?\", \"Is that the thought you\\'re having?Goo Morning Joe, how are you at the moment?what\\'s troubling youYeah.Why would they think that?How do they know how you feel?Are they?Who should that\\'s that\\'s talking about.\", \"This is the new job that you startedYou mentioned that they know what you are.What makes you say that?What feelings are those?a bit more.the physical feeling that?Is it out there all the time?about this sensation, How does that feel?\", \"Does it feel like you ?Have you have you seen anything?How can you account for that sensation?\", \"If if there\\'s not actually anything there?Is there anything else strange that you can feel?Do you ever have any sort of unusual other sensations like hearing things that that other people wouldn\\'t see things that aren\\'t that?And These people  know how you feel, can they read your mind?\", \"Do you think maybe it could be that they\\'re just glancing your way or looking?Does anybody else comment it Other people are looking at you or they actually said to you that you\\'re disgusting.Do you ever get the feeling that your thoughts are sort of known to everyone that they\\'re being broadcast or projected out of your your mind?You\\'re not sure.Okay.\", \"What about people inserting thoughts into your mind we\\'ll take your thoughts outDo you think you\\'re in control of your own thoughts?Are you in control of your own body?\", \"Or do you feel that somebody else may be moving parts of you or causing these unusual sensationsNow you you\\'ve had these feelings before happened to Joe.\", \"Remind me when when did they first begin?Do you he was trying to have sex with you?And you were under a lot of stress, Do you think at that timeAnd you got quite suspicious then as well didn\\'t do that.\", \"what people are thinking the worst?Yeah.\", \"Okay, because you\\'ve tried different courses.\", \"And each time you you Try Of course to go back to to work.\", \"It kind of upsets you, doesn\\'t it?Okay, that must be quite disappointing and upsetting for you.How is your mood at the moment?Have you got much energy?You\\'re quiet down.Are you keeping interest in anythings, Is there anything that that you find enjoyment in?what about your energy levels You\\'re tired all the time?How about your sleep?Are you concentrating, able to pay attention to things?Yes.\", \"Well, I can see that it\\'s playing on your mind.\", \"I\\'m just wondering what other impact that\\'s had on you.\", \"Are you able to get from that and mix with peopleWhat\\'s going on?\", \"What are you feeling right now?Disgust about what.Like you can\\'t do this.\", \"So, so tell me what that feeling of disgust is.\", \"What do you disgust it about?Yeah.\", \"Well, it sounds like there\\'s some judgments in there.\", \"Right.\", \"So it sounds like probably you\\'re having some judgments like, I\\'m feeling really bad.\", \"that sort of thing.\", \"But you did say it more descriptively which is great, which is you\\'re feeling uncomfortable right now.Yeah.\", \"And I can totally understand how you get to there.\", \"If you\\'re thinking, I\\'m feeling fat.\", \"I\\'m going to get fat.\", \"You know, it\\'s an easy place to get to.\", \"Okay.\", \"But I feel like we\\'re missing something, too, because I don\\'t think it\\'s justice.\", \"I think there\\'s another primary emotion in there.\", \"What do you think that might be?Sure.\", \"So what what emotion do you think that is?I think that\\'s exactly right.\", \"That\\'s what I\\'m seeing.\", \"You know, I see you kind of crawled up over there.\", \"You know, you have a very worried faced, you know, and you\\'re having a hard time approaching it.\", \"I think I think that\\'s absolutely right, that you\\'re feeling fear.\", \"And I want you to know, that makes a lot of sense to me.\", \"You know, when\\'s the last time you\\'ve eaten cheesecake.I know it\\'s been it\\'s been a really long time.\", \"you certainly didn\\'t need it all through, you know, when you were really stuck in your eating disorder, you know,I know And so you\\'ve been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you\\'re feeling fear.And you had said, this is one of the hardest foods for you.\", \"So that makes sense to me.rightthat\\'s what.\", \"what!\", \"what is that?\", \"It\\'s a big blob of fat.Yeah, exactly.\", \"You know, I\\'m not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.\", \"So, because that\\'s just not going to be helpful right now.\", \"So what I\\'m wondering is Since we know that it\\'s fear that we\\'re dealing with, maybe we can do some opposite action to that emotion.\", \"Do you remember what I mean by opposite action?What do I mean?Right, exactly.\", \"So, you know, fears associated with that urge, like you said, to run out the door.\", \"So instead of running out the door, we want you to approach the thing that\\'s scary, which is this cheesecake right now.\", \"Right?\", \"Okay.\", \"So I see how hard it is.\", \"For you and I, honestly, it\\'s hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away.\", \"But as you know, the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake, it\\'s just gonna make you more fearful The next time you come in front of some kind of food, that\\'s tougher for youYeah.\", \"So by doing this, hopefully over time, your fear will go down.\", \"Okay.\", \"So can we have the fear right now And still take a few more bites?All right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Let\\'s do it.\", \"So how was that?Yeah, I can see how difficult it is.Exactly.No, I wouldn\\'t imagine it would.\", \"But you did perfect opposite action right there, which is you are feeling really uncomfortable and I can tell that, but you still did it.\", \"Do you feel a little bit proud of yourself?Okay.\", \"So this shows me that you can do it.\", \"So let\\'s try again.\", \"Let\\'s take a breath.\", \"And then we\\'ll go back and do more opposite action.So, alright, let\\'s take a step back and talk about competency.\", \"What education Did you need for the job you have now?Are you evaluated at work by anybody to see if you\\'re in a job you should be?Have you been Found in that system to be somebody who\\'s satisfying the requirements of in terms of competency satisfy the requirements of employee.that\\'s a good sign.\", \"Yeah, you haven\\'t been fired.\", \"Have you ever had any type of write up or somebody discussing something with you?Alright, so there\\'s no there\\'s no evidence supporting that.\", \"In a kind of a direct fashion, like a supervisor coming to, but there\\'s no other evidence supporting it based on your, what you\\'re feeling, how you\\'re perceiving things.\", \"Yeah, you\\'re getting this feeling that, by the way, they\\'re interacting with you.Alright, so you can see that I\\'m talking this through you can see that.\", \"So some of this could be feelings.\", \"Thoughts you\\'re having, combined with what you\\'re actually observing share, you\\'re filtering your observations in a way that\\'s maybe making them seem a little more destructive, or more negative.Can you can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where where they said something that you thought maybe was referring back to this?So she referred to as a bulldozer.\", \"And one way to take that would be powerful, efficient.\", \"Another way to take that would be kind of destructive we talked about before destructive powers.\", \"They\\'re mechanical they don\\'t have a lot of feeling.So you don\\'t know exactly know how she meant it but you\\'re thinking maybe it was negativeSo her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are maybe you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough.So, maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment.\", \"At the time making a decision, you would have thought through the steps more.Tell me about sure for any spiritual beliefs.So you consider yourself Catholic.\", \"But you feel like there\\'s a lot of rules.How do you think those spiritual values influence your daily life?How about racial ethnic identity?Mexican.Family oriented.Can you tell me about your living housing situation?the past year.So, there\\'s a part of it\\'s not so bad.How much for financial outlookSo occasionally you\\'ll borrow money.All right.\", \"How about your sleep?\", \"Do you feel like you sleep as much as you should?\", \"More than you should or less than you\\'re sureTell me about that.Or is that a problem that you want to work on?How about food intake eating?\", \"Do you feel like you eat more than you should less than you should or about right?Is that an area that you want to work on?\", \"Do you see that as a problem?And maybe I want to switch gears again here.\", \"Trauma history.\", \"Now.\", \"You already told me about the What do you think may have happened or could have happened with your father?\", \"How about any physical abuse?\", \"I think you mentioned that earlier, right?Physical fights, yeah.Tell me what you mean by involved.Well, what do you think happened in those situations?\", \"You feel like that?You were targeted?And you would act out physically against them to defend yourself.on occasion?How about emotional abuse?about that,That was painful for you.Do you think that had an impact or that or the physical abuse had an impact on your life?\", \"What\\'s happening now?So you think your mother\\'s behavior led to the way your sister treats you now?Any other instances of physical or emotional abuse?Okay, I understand you\\'ve been having some symptoms with a which have been bothersome.\", \"You tell me about thosealright so you have excessive sleep you feel like what is excessive sleepAnd you mentioned your appetite as well.how long have these symptoms been present?over the last two weeks.out of, say one week, how many days do you have these symptoms?every day?So I\\'m gonna ask you some other questions related to this.\", \"Okay, just provide me the best answer you can.\", \"In the last two weeks, have you found yourself?\", \"depressed, sad, hopeless.\", \"I know that.Have you lost interest in activities that used to be fun for you?Do you ever feel agitated in terms of like movement?\", \"Like you can\\'t stop moving or find yourself trying to resist moving?That\\'s been happening.Any changes in terms of your level of energy?So the excessive sleep has affected your level of energy.\", \"How about any type of feeling of worthlessness or anything like that?you know, be yourself desirable.I\\'m always up to swearabout your concentration Have you found any changes there and your ability to concentrateshould you having trouble focusing?Do you ever have any Thoughts of death or dying?no, no.You mentioned thatthese symptoms have been causing problems at work any other areas where they\\'ve beencausing trouble?\", \"Like limiting or functioningsocial life Relationships life at homeHow about substances you use any alcohol or drugs like that?thought about medical conditionsdo you ever see or hear things that other people can\\'t see or hear?Have you ever had that happen?Have you ever had a period your life were you having it now?\", \"Where?\", \"You\\'re extremely happy how a lot of energyoakyoakySherry I\\'m going to refer you to see a counselor.\", \"I\\'ve just scheduled and so you can see them in next couple days if that works for you.\", \"Yeah, that works fine.\", \"I appreciate you answering these questions.\", \"This has been helpful.\", \"Thanks.Afternoon.\", \"I\\'m glad you could get in today.Yes, last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety, and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety.\", \"And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes.\", \"You were going to attempt to drink less coffee.\", \"You were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature.\", \"So I\\'m wondering how all that went?Okay, so it sounds like you\\'ve made some movement forward towards your goals.\", \"You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn\\'t have yoga classes.\", \"You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one.\", \"And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk.\", \"But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue.\", \"Getting out more with people.So it\\'s uncomfortable for you to be To around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking, and how does that make you feel?Okay, so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious.\", \"So I\\'m wondering what we could do about that.That would absolutely be one option.\", \"You could invite people over to your house, and then you could get to choose who you\\'re around.And in terms of the yoga, let\\'s get back to the yoga for a minute.\", \"Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes.Mm hmm.\", \"And so if I were to ask you right now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to 10?Okay.So when you see the pictures on your newsfeed, it makes you excited about doing it.\", \"But when you actually go to do it, it makes it more challenging.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"And so you\\'re thinking that you\\'re not as flexible as the other people.\", \"I\\'m wondering if that\\'s what Yoga is about flexibility?Mm hmm.\", \"So you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest?And you\\'d be a beginner?Okay.\", \"So what do you think would happen if you couldn\\'t do the poses in class?Okay.\", \"So you\\'d be embarrassed if you couldn\\'t do the certain policies.\", \"And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the classAnd so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class?What would what would cause you to not being able to do it?I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible.\", \"And I\\'m wondering, what would make that difference between then and now?and How would it be if you couldn\\'t do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed?What would be the payoff?\", \"Do you think?\", \"If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?You know, I can give you I\\'ve lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down.\", \"As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications.\", \"So I\\'m not sure if you were if you knew that or not.Okay.\", \"So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?Good, good.\", \"That\\'s a definite improvement.\", \"And, and you could determine after that first class, whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not.\", \"And that, would that be validation for you?\", \"Or would that be?\", \"It gives you even more motivation?\", \"If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class?\", \"Okay.\", \"So one other thing that I wanted to, to mention to you was, you said that you\\'d walk your dog in nature and curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature.\", \"Wow.And so because of it, it was cold and windy.\", \"You decided to kind of cut the walk short.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And and that\\'s definitely understandable.\", \"I\\'m wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day.Okay, so if you took a jacket in cases cold, yeah.\", \"And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful, that you could be in that would help you even more.\", \"Enjoy itexcellent.\", \"Is It\\'s great that you have trails around your house where you\\'re not exposed to all that noise.And on a scale of one to 10 tell me what that probably means.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So it sounds like last week, you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety.\", \"You really couldn\\'t find a yoga class because you\\'re already signed up for a gym that doesn\\'t have the yoga classes.\", \"But you already know about the yoga videos that I\\'ve sent you so you could actually do them at home.you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home?\", \"And then there would be no embarrassment factor.\", \"If you couldn\\'t do the poses less coffee, you\\'ve gone from two cups to one cup that\\'s very good.\", \"And get out more with people, you\\'ve decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who\\'s going to be in your space.\", \"That\\'s always an apprehensive moment when you don\\'t know you have no control over who\\'s going to be in your space.\", \"And on a scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog?Fabulous and how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week?\", \"How much of a difference Do you think it would make you feel?And how would it make you feel?And so you\\'d feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would do.Are you doing today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"I understand you had some symptoms recently they\\'ve been bothering you.Could you tell me about those?Tell me about how these presentations are set up.and you say that this situation the presentation you said it\\'s killing you.would feeling so you haveSo, so this is this is distressing for you.And this is probably difficult to, to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what\\'s going on then?You\\'re not you\\'re not happy with the quality of your prison.\", \"Now even even when you\\'re able to kind of stay there and conducted, so I want to divide this into the stages.\", \"So we talked about the very beginning.\", \"So you\\'re already having anxieties sounds like it\\'s fairly intense at that point.\", \"Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations.\", \"Tell me about what you\\'re feeling as, as the presentations come around to you.So before before the presentations come around to you, you get up and yeah, leave the room.\", \"So in those times when you\\'ve stayed in the room and you\\'ve done the presentation, so the anxiety, the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room and when it comes to you actually giving your presentation.\", \"You\\'re not happy with that but what strings it level like during your presentation.See if you\\'ve had these symptoms for a long time, they\\'ve been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you haven\\'t had to be in front of other people.So it interferes with your functioning.\", \"Maybe a little bit.\", \"But if you\\'re not having to present, it\\'s not as big a deal as it is now for you.\", \"Yes job.\", \"it\\'s really affecting it.\", \"So are you taking any measures?\", \"Or have you take any measures other than drinking, you mentioned, to avoid a situation to avoid?\", \"This is too painful.\", \"If you had the other job, his other job would involve presentations.\", \"So you\\'d be happier.\", \"You\\'d have fewer symptoms in that job.\", \"What\\'s been the result of that discussion?\", \"Has there been anything has happened as far as well.All right, so you\\'ve you\\'ve tried, you try to cope with anxiety.\", \"You\\'ve had to leave colon, colon sick or come in late.\", \"You\\'ve looked for different position or doesn\\'t involve presenting.\", \"You\\'ve had this problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations beforeDo you or have you seen any symptoms like this and your parents?Right?\", \"So there may be maybe a history, a family history of symptoms.\", \"like these, this distressing for you, you tried to avoid it and deal with it but you haven\\'t been you don\\'t feel you\\'ve been very successful coping with it.We\\'ll get you in for treatment we\\'ll catch in the next couple days to see a counselor.\", \"If that\\'s what you\\'d like to do.think that could help.\", \"And I want to thank you for spending this time with me.\", \"It\\'s really helped me to understand better what you\\'re, you\\'re facing.\", \"Thanks, Sasha.my advice would be for you or your daughter to at least and a week at the program.So what are you looking for?if I give you three more programs, Will that work?\", \"need to give it a chance you need to go and visit again.at least whenever out of your busy schedule,So the program that you\\'re interested, you want me to go with you or you want me to, I want you to want me to doOkay, well looking at my schedule, it probably won\\'t be until maybe two weeks my schedule is pretty much tied up.The case just got transferred to me so I\\'m not very familiar with your situation.So you\\'re looking, you\\'re looking for a day program, right?\", \"And something that really was good for your daughter.You while you were there, it was difficult.\", \"Your daughter didn\\'t really kind of fit in or connect with anybody while you were visiting.And so so just there wasn\\'t when when you visited they didn\\'t sort of the program didn\\'t help you to connect cert help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were just sort of viewing it.Hi You How you doing today.I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.Your brother Bhushan today and he\\'s had some concerns about your mood.Yeah.\", \"You feel like you\\'re getting a lot accomplished at work at home and what types of things youSo your mood is moods up.\", \"They your brother specifically had concerns about spending money.So you haven\\'t you haven\\'t gotten any trouble at work, or at home or anything?Okay.\", \"Any changes with your sleep habits?\", \"Um,So how much did you sleep last night?You feel rested?Sure have a lot of energy.Do you have any feelings of depression or anything like that?\", \"sadness?Oh, great.\", \"Yeah, feel great.\", \"Have you ever had anything like that?\", \"How long goes that?few years ago?\", \"Any thoughts about death or dying or anything related to that?any drug or alcohol use?No.\", \"How you doing medically?\", \"Anything medically going on?Sure?\", \"You answering these questions for me has been helpful.\", \"I know that you\\'re feeling well.But I\\'d like you to talk to a counselor if that\\'s okay.\", \"I know that you\\'re where your brother\\'s concerned.your friend.\", \"Okay, so it\\'d be okay with you.\", \"I\\'d like you to speak with a counselor, at least for a little bit.\", \"I can arrange that in just a few moments if that\\'s okay, Thanks.Alisa How you doing today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.How has the anxiety been going?I subsided a bit.\", \"That\\'s good.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s good.\", \"How\\'s things been going at work lately?So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings?\", \"Right.\", \"And you mentioned that she\\'s not showing you respect and that you deserve respect.\", \"Right?\", \"effect.\", \"So tell me, tell me about that.\", \"Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences.\", \"In our abt, tell me about that belief.other levels of respect.\", \"There\\'s a certain level of respect that you demand or need.and what did she do?\", \"That kind of convinced you that she wasn\\'t meeting that level of respect?Have you criticized other coworkers?So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you\\'ve kind of seen there regularlyat the time when you were?So you felt that she was a bit harsh.\", \"You talk to her about it, but then she\\'s become more harsh.\", \"So where do you stand with her now?\", \"Like the meeting?\", \"Well,It\\'s not convenient.\", \"Yeah.\", \"It might not help.\", \"Alright.\", \"So let\\'s work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before.\", \"Right?\", \"That was troublesome to you before.\", \"What would the activating event be here in this situation?Was this criticism?That\\'s a feelingwas aggravation, yeah.\", \"frustration, frustration.\", \"So that\\'s, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior.\", \"Does that make sense?\", \"Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event.\", \"She criticizes you.\", \"Your belief is that you deserve respect.\", \"And clearly she violated that belief.\", \"Right?\", \"She She didn\\'t show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system.\", \"And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration.\", \"Were there any other consequences?To get that\\'s, that\\'s definitely a consequence.\", \"I\\'m thinking there\\'s an intermediate consequence stuff.\", \"So you had that feeling of frustration.\", \"And what\\'s the next thing you did after that meeting was over, you confronted her?\", \"Right.\", \"So you have kind of those two consequences.\", \"And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event.\", \"You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical.\", \"So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.Does that make some some sense?Sure, exactly.\", \"So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future.\", \"Right.\", \"So we can\\'t go back and change that, but we can work on the future.\", \"So her criticism of you there\\'s no direct way to change that.\", \"consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right?\", \"One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way.\", \"But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren\\'t meeting it.\", \"Right.\", \"Would you say that\\'s a fair?Okay.\", \"Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you\\'d like respect?\", \"respects good.\", \"Yeah.\", \"respects healthy and work environments, certainly.\", \"But if you don\\'t get it, you can still function.\", \"It\\'s tough for you.\", \"I can see that\\'s tough.\", \"Tell me about that.Mm hmm.\", \"Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?Yeah.\", \"Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.this has been a relatively persistent part of your life.\", \"Let\\'s play system.\", \"So changing it\\'s going to be work.So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking?\", \"Next time you\\'re in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.\", \"So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I\\'m being disrespected again.\", \"I it probably comes on that way.\", \"You kind of feel it.So it\\'ll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction.\", \"But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I\\'d like respect, right.\", \"But I can survive and function without it.\", \"At some level, I can accept that.\", \"I\\'m not going to get it all the time.\", \"Other other areas of life for you do get respect.\", \"So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you\\'ll know that to be really Can\\'t control someone else\\'s behavior.\", \"But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions.\", \"You don\\'t want them to have to come and sort that out.\", \"Right, you can sort out their own.\", \"And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking.\", \"So is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week?So really our plan move forward as a couple parts.\", \"So one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you\\'re aware what\\'s going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I\\'ll function adequately without respect from everyone.\", \"I know that\\'s tough.\", \"That\\'s gonna be that\\'s gonna be the challenge, right?\", \"But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice.\", \"Does it all make sense to you?So, let\\'s work on those two, those two elements.\", \"Right and next time you come in, we\\'ll check in on those two and make any needed modifications to our strategy and we\\'ll kind of move forward from there.\", \"that sounds good.Thanks, Lisa.\", \"So Tommy I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know, you\\'re such a good kid, like, I don\\'t know what you\\'re doing drinking.\", \"It\\'s not good and it will ruin your lifeI Tommy there\\'s so many consequences with drinking you know you\\'re not even 21 yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know, mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you.\", \"It just really really concerns me.There\\'s really no such thing as not drinking too much.\", \"I mean, anything that\\'s drinking when you\\'re under age is drinking too much.\", \"You know, like, think about it.\", \"Think about all the things that can happen to you.how much are you drinking?it\\'s like, every weekend.Tommy, I\\'m just so concerned, you know, can\\'t you think of anything better to do?Yeah, are your friends the problem?\", \"Like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you\\'re partying with?Well, there\\'s a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren\\'t a good choice, right?\", \"That\\'s some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what\\'s best for you.\", \"And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.I think you really need to quit.Think you\\'re wrong.\", \"You know, it really worries me.\", \"Anyway, I wish you would quit.\", \"If all you\\'re gonna do is cut down that\\'s better than nothing.\", \"You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I\\'m gonna keep talking to you about it.\", \"It\\'s really important.\", \"Yeah,um, do you want to wait for that to happen?\", \"Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?All right.\", \"Well, maybe it\\'s something we can work on together.\", \"And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that\\'s gonna work for you so that you can get to trial here and stop drinking.Okay.\", \"Sounds good.Alright, so let\\'s see if we could just talk about the moment of the presentation again.\", \"I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down.\", \"Let\\'s actually go right before the moment so you\\'re still in the, you\\'re still sitting down, and you\\'re getting ready to present.\", \"Let\\'s just say your second present.\", \"Yeah, like we\\'ve talked about and you\\'re thinking they\\'re going to seeming as anxious.\", \"They\\'re gonna think I don\\'t belong here.\", \"These are the right.\", \"Okay.\", \"So these thoughts occur because you have an expectation rule one add to that you brought into that class, when you walked into that class, you have these expectations already.\", \"It\\'s perfectly natural.\", \"It\\'s not right or wrong.\", \"Everyone has these beliefs.\", \"And whenever these beliefs are and we\\'ll talk about that another point, they combined with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you, right, and the classmates watching you, and they result in these thoughts.\", \"We call them automatic thoughts,  And just like the beliefs, they\\'re not good or bad.\", \"They don\\'t say anything about the person having them.\", \"They\\'re just thoughts.\", \"Actually, they\\'re fairly understandable and natural thoughts.\", \"The problem is that they lead to symptoms.\", \"So, you\\'re sitting there at your desk, and you\\'re thinking, they\\'re gonna see that I\\'m anxious.\", \"They\\'re gonna realize I\\'m not good enough.\", \"I think I\\'m not good enough, right?\", \"What reaction Do you have when you have that far?so distressing symptoms.What\\'s something that you could send yourself in that moment, that would maybe get in between that thought, and that reaction, so that thought of, I\\'m not gonna know I\\'m not good enough.\", \"I think I\\'m not good enough.\", \"And that reactionOkay.\", \"So some some deep breathing, looking over your notes, like preparing yourself for kind of focusing on that and realizing they\\'re not really looking at you anyway for a moment.\", \"Okay, good.\", \"Good.\", \"Um, you bring your notes with you to class?Okay.\", \"So You always have those with you.It\\'s just a matter of can you focus your attention on them?And you know, if you\\'re focusing on that, and you\\'re thinking about that, you\\'re not thinking about whatever they might be thinking aboutAnd how about the deep breathing?\", \"Is that a strategy you\\'ve tried before?So you\\'ve been able to do it sometimes.HI Sam, Thanks for waiting.\", \"I talked to your mom a little bit about some of the things that were going on at home in school.\", \"And now I\\'m going to spend a few minutes with you asking you some questions.\", \"The questions I ask all the kids, some of them are going to kind of fit for you and some of them might not fit so well.\", \"But if there\\'s things that you\\'re curious about, I\\'m asking or if you have questions as we\\'re talking, then feel free to ask me about why I\\'m asking something or ask any questions.\", \"Okay.\", \"The first thing I wanted to check in about was how have things been going at home?\", \"Okay.\", \"You guess.\", \"And sounds like there\\'s a lot of things that have happened.\", \"Lots of stressors and lots of things that have happened hasn\\'t Mom doing with all of that stuff.Have there ever been a time where you feel like your mom isn\\'t able to get out of bed or do the things that she needs to do?So she\\'s getting out of bed and she\\'s looking after you.most of the time, they won\\'t watch us most of the time mean?What are some of the things that you might think she might do a bit better?Is your mom having Cheerios with you?\", \"Are you on your own having Cheerios what your mom doingyou\\'re by yourself having Cheerios.Okay.\", \"And if you\\'ve been worried about having food it\\'s ever been a concern of yoursSo how\\'s your mama doing?Are there ever any times that she seems down or upset for days at a time that she hasn\\'t been getting out of bed?\", \"For that she seems to be having a really tough time.Can you tell me more about what you mean by a little bit stressed?\", \"Sowho has grandma and mom?Can you tell me a little bit more about that?And when they are you and yell, have there ever been times that you\\'ve been afraid that someone might get hurt?once?\", \"Can you tell me a bit about that time?So the fighting between your grandma and your mom, how intense does it get?\", \"Is it arguing or is it yelling, screaming?\", \"When they are human?\", \"Have there been times when anybody\\'s been physical use their fists or hands?Any other way that they may have physically been fighting?What about throwing objects or no?And what happens to you when they\\'re fighting?\", \"Where are you?Just so you\\'re going to hear from me and knowing kind of what happens afterwards.So when they\\'re fighting, it\\'s what I\\'m hearing is it\\'s words,So you\\'re feeling criticized by grandma.\", \"What about mom?\", \"Has she ever said mean or hurtful things to you?Sam, has anybody touched your body in an inappropriate way or a way that you didn\\'t like?Has anyone touched your private parts or touched you in a sexual way?\", \"Sam, does anybody in your house ever hit or spank you?\", \"What about hurting your body as anyone hurt your body?\", \"So when I say hurt, I mean things like hitting, kicking, punching, scratching.\", \"So no one\\'s hurt you sexually or Physical with anyone in your house?\", \"Has anyone been drinking or ever been worried about people drinking too much or getting drunk or?\", \"No?\", \"What about other drugs?So you don\\'t have any worries about your parents using drugs or alcohol?\", \"What about Grandma, anybody else in your family that you\\'re worried about in that way?\", \"So Sam, how do you feel in your close relationships?\", \"Do you feel loved and cared about and special?So you\\'re not feeling loved?\", \"Is there any place in your life with any adults or with anyone that you\\'re feeling love?\", \"Like me in my room?So if you had a problem, or you were hurt in some way or something was happening, who would you go to for help?\", \"Or what would you do?And is anybody in your family ever been in jail or in prison?\", \"So the stressors in your house and what\\'s going on?\", \"Making your mom not be there for you as much?What are what do you think of some of those stressful things?You want to go your mom told me that you You and your mom aren\\'t together anymore and that he\\'s moved out to BC to see your dad.\", \"Now, when was the last time you saw him a year ago?\", \"Is there a plan for you to see him?\", \"No, no.\", \"What I\\'ve heard is that, you know, there\\'s some stressors and some things that are hard for you in your life.\", \"And you talk to me about the arguing that\\'s happening between your mom and your grandma.\", \"That, that your dad has moved away, that you\\'re not always in the right clothes and you have to fix some of your meals.\", \"And that you\\'re not always feeling loved and special.\", \"But you\\'ve also told me that nobody\\'s hurting you in a physical or verbal or sexual way.\", \"No, nobody\\'s saying mean things to you.\", \"That you\\'re not worried about your mom emotionally and that she\\'s not worried about her all the time.\", \"Struggling more emotionally?\", \"And that nobody you know is in prison, or has been in prison now.\", \"And you don\\'t have any concerns about drugs or drinking or in your home?\", \"Sam, do you think some of those stressors are what\\'s making it hard for you at school?Yeah.\", \"Why do you think that might be?I know that a lot of that makes a lot of sense, Sam, that when things are stressful at home that kids have trouble concentrating and it affects them at school.\", \"So I\\'m going to talk to your mom more and we\\'re going to try and figure out a way that I can help you and your mom with some of that stuff.Jackie, you all right?\", \"been having a rough time?.\", \"I understand there have been some difficulties lately to push into the agency.\", \"Tell me what\\'s going on.And what did you notice right away so, so one of the boxers was sounds like knocked out a noose.\", \"You saw that.\", \"What did you notice right away was happening.So you left and the symptoms, they continued.What was that about?I do find that you\\'re having memories of the, the incident of the boxing match that are Kind of intrusive.But I suppose some for you.\", \"And you try but you Yeah, remember any dreams related to it?any times when you feel like you\\'re reliving what you saw like you\\'re seeing it again.Does anything keep reminding you of the boxing match?\", \"And then that\\'s causing you to have symptoms?Do you find yourself working to avoid like, music too similar?Do you find that you\\'ve had any trouble remembering what happened?you Have you been irritable at all since the incident?How about your awareness level of what surrounds you?\", \"Do you find that your awareness level has increased that you\\'re, you\\'re more aware?so you feel like your reaction to that was stronger than it normally would have been?Have you used drugs or alcohol recently?\", \"Any medical problems?So Jackie, I\\'m going to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency if that\\'s something that you\\'re okay with.Just take a couple days to get you on to get you in to see somebody to get you on the scheduling agenda, see somebody and I\\'ll get that arranged.\", \"How are you?\", \"Not well?what\\'s going on.I remember that.That\\'s terrible.\", \"I\\'m sorry to hear that.You should talk about the job.\", \"You\\'re happy there.and that\\'s not gonna happen.\", \"No, no.\", \"How does this affect your financial outlook like your bills and such?So it definitely caught you off guard.\", \"Do you have enough income with your husband\\'s job to cover your basic bills?to know about how long you have for you fail to meet any financial commitments.What thoughts have you been having?Now, you said you were laid off, right?\", \"For the position.\", \"Are you eligible for unemployment?Because if you I mean, I\\'m not a labor law expert.\", \"But I think if you\\'re, if you\\'re laid off, there\\'s probably decent probability you could get on employment.\", \"How much for educational?Well, that\\'s, that\\'s more than most bachelor\\'s degree.\", \"Yeah.\", \"You just haven\\'t had to look for a job in a long time, right here.\", \"Because I\\'m guessing you thought you\\'re gonna retire.So this is upsetting for a lot of reasons.\", \"So you have The financial stressors, right?\", \"I can\\'t be minimized.\", \"The relational stressors mentioned, it\\'s kind of embarrassing.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s more like an identity thing I see identify with what you did right now.\", \"You don\\'t as much, because you\\'re not actively working in it.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Did you ever have any co workers who voluntarily left for other jobs?Not at the time you worked there.So a lot of people stay.Have you ever known anybody who worked for a similar company or in the same field?\", \"Who change jobs?would you need to replace that full income to pay your bills or part of that income?So we\\'ve talked about problem solving skills before in earlier sessions, right.\", \"So have you applied a those concepts to what\\'s going on now.So there\\'s sort of an upside, and then sense the time part, at some point need to replace the income.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s very pragmatic in the money.\", \"Have you considered that if you attempted to seek a full time job to work out, you could look at part time jobs.What would it What would it mean about you?\", \"What would it say about you if you had to take a part time job, so finding another full time job is so much of the loss?So you would you would internalize that and Meaning would be that you\\'re not as valuable.So it speaks to self worth.Yeah.\", \"And these these behaviors are all things that potentially could impede your goal.\", \"So it is kind of like a self fulfilling prophecy element to this.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Do you agonize you worry, invest in these thoughts?\", \"Right?\", \"And then to temporarily take away the pain you drink?\", \"Yeah.\", \"That ends up being more dysfunction, right with a relationship with your husband.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Imagine if you\\'re intoxicated, you\\'re not looking for new work.\", \"Yeah.\", \"That wouldn\\'t be ideal timing.\", \"So, in a sense, you\\'re, you\\'re not helping things to improve.\", \"And it all kind of starts without thinking, And that ties into that kind of worthless, type five.\", \"So you\\'re fulfilling that role.\", \"worthless.\", \"That sounds manifesting for you.\", \"And that\\'s one thing you can do.\", \"That\\'s an option you can drink and you could have relational struggles.\", \"But is that really?\", \"Is that really what you want at all?\", \"Is that the most useful?\", \"How do you think you could break that cycle?Well, that makes sense.\", \"Yeah, so the first step would be figuring out what The minimum amount you really need, right?\", \"So you\\'ll shoot for hire full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which I want free time to decline.\", \"Right?\", \"So it makes sense.\", \"So armed with that information and you could go into the workplace, right?\", \"And it was less anxiety kind of just know this Job\\'s gonna if I get it, that\\'s good, right Lord, I might as well not apply to this one because it\\'s not gonna work.\", \"So as efficient as time say, it\\'s good.\", \"That sounds logical.That worries Yeah, no worries.\", \"nagging Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"SoYeah.\", \"It would be difficult, right?\", \"To be fair, right?\", \"It would be difficult, but you would adapt.So if we pick up with that we say that\\'s really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive responses to automatic thoughts, right?\", \"So if you\\'re telling yourself that you have the depression and certainly anxiety, craving to drink, you tell yourself well, the worst that could happen is I don\\'t work the rest of my life again, acknowledging that\\'s pretty unlikely.\", \"But the worst thing to happen is I won\\'t work again.\", \"And I might have to adapt, I might have to have a simpler life in terms of material goods and small house, but I would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood, or your thoughts?So there\\'s a piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what the worst case scenario could be.\", \"Right?\", \"And probably another part of the adaptive response could be, you know, I could live to the worst case scenario.\", \"I think it\\'s important to acknowledge that it\\'s unlikely.\", \"that\\'s unlikely.\", \"Right?\", \"So statistics probability is on your side here.\", \"Right?\", \"So, as you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment, you\\'ll probably have some, some interviews, we don\\'t get a job offers, right.\", \"But eventually, if I have one where you do, yeah, right.\", \"It\\'s, it\\'s just math.\", \"Right?\", \"If you can accept the worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption, reduce that depression, anxiety.So Let\\'s end there for today.\", \"But I want you to try for the next week.\", \"I want to try plan that adaptive response, right?\", \"Actually, there\\'s two we\\'re talking about right?\", \"One is you could survive the worst case scenario.\", \"And the other one is that probabilistically It won\\'t happen.\", \"Right?\", \"So you have kind of two.\", \"Well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up, like, I\\'m never gonna work again.\", \"Okay, this is a catastrophe.\", \"So like that self talk.\", \"Yeah, apply that self talk.\", \"So identify that automatic thought, because we\\'ve talked about that skill, right?\", \"And then apply that self talk right away.\", \"All right, and let\\'s see, you have the thought record.\", \"Right.\", \"So when that you know, when you can fill one of those out, okay, when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response, even if you can\\'t get it completely filled out, I understand that.\", \"I know there\\'s a lot on there.\", \"Just what you can get done on that.\", \"Anything you can do.\", \"That would be helpful.\", \"Sound good?So scheduled for one week.\", \"So I\\'ll see you then we\\'ll see how this goes to progress we can make on this on the alcohol and the depression and anxiety.Jason, how you doing, sir?\", \"You all right?You\\'re just here, just here.\", \"I understand that you\\'re in the hospital a couple weeks ago.What happened?what you think the government is trying to do.And tell me about your room.\", \"What what are you doing there that makes that special.Is that how you were feeling when you were building?That\\'s what you\\'re trying to doThey could be happy, they could be happy, like, you know, you were happy.So you had a period of time when you had like a lot of energy and you weren\\'t really sleeping muchYou\\'re also happy and felt energeticAnd how do you feel now in comparison?So not happy or sad.Do you want to get back to that happinessYeah.\", \"You mentioned you ordered some products online.\", \"How much did you order?He would have been affected by a machine.Were all those hard drives fairly expensive?How\\'d your mother respond to that?Is that strange relationship?you get along, okay.\", \"And you mentioned that they changed medications in the hospital.How are you feeling about taking your medications?Right, you you really want to get back to work on that machine.Have you found yourself as motivated these last couple weeks as you were before you\\'re hospitalized?You still want to get that done.\", \"It\\'s important to know.by Jason, I\\'d like you to continue seeing a counselor here.\", \"If you found the counsellor to be helpful.But that okay, it\\'s been okay.\", \"But we\\'ll continue to counseling and hope that can can help you a bit.\", \"I appreciate you spending this time with me and explain what happened.\", \"Jackie, I joined today.\", \"Okay, how about you?I understand you\\'ve been having some difficulties recently that have brought you into the agency.So I can understand why that would be distressing.\", \"Have you seen a physician about this?that might be going on.\", \"So what would you like from counseling?So, after you were yelling things, or you hit him, like you\\'re asleep during this time, when you wake up, what\\'s going through your mind then?Sorry.\", \"I wonder if you have this disorder before?So he\\'s been paying attention to what\\'s going on with your sleep.\", \"Does the episode of yelling or moving around, does it happen a certain time limit?\", \"Like what happened right after you go to sleep or a whiledoes that ever happen when you take like a nap for a short nap?Not that I knowSo only at night when you\\'re sleeping overnight and in the middle of that sleep.\", \"All right, would you be okay with sign a release so I can communicate with your question.\", \"And do you want your husband to be part of the counseling?And you\\'d be okay saying release for him?So I\\'ll get you scheduled into see a counselor.\", \"I appreciate you tell me what\\'s going on.\", \"Now, one thing I thought we might do today is to get an example of one of these situations in which you get really anxious.\", \"And try to see if we can understand more about how you think and how you feel when you\\'re in the middle of one of those situations.\", \"So can you think of an example of something that\\'s happened recently?\", \"so to try to understand what goes through your mind that\\'s trying to take you back.\", \"And now you know that the prescriptions there and your daughter\\'s sick and I guess you don\\'t want to ask her to drive over there.\", \"I sorted Yeah, probably not the wisest idea.\", \"So you\\'re thinking about doing the drive and what\\'s going through your mind?\", \"What are the thoughts that are turning inside?Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Pretty scary.And Kate as you as you put yourself back into that situation and have those thoughts going through your mind.\", \"What kinds of feelings go along with it?\", \"It\\'s just a panic attack now?\", \"He told me about having some bad ones.Yeah, no, it\\'s brewing.yeah.\", \"What do you think we might do to try to, to move things along toward getting a plan of attack on this, okay, is to actually sketch this out.\", \"Okay, and, and then see if we can figure out some things we might be able to start doing to give you a better handle on that you have right now.\", \"Okay.\", \"So let\\'s put some boxes here.\", \"And one of them is going to be event these are the things that trigger your anxiety.\", \"In this case, the event wasdrive to pharmacy.\", \"And then this next box, I\\'m gonna label something we call automatic thoughts.\", \"And but automatic, I mean that they occur relatively automatically, they just sort of pop into your mind, and you don\\'t stop to check them out.\", \"Okay, and we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts.\", \"You don\\'t have them, everybody I know has them their inner thoughts.\", \"In fact, if you think about it for a minute, we probably have a lot more thoughts.\", \"We don\\'t speak out loud, that are part of our inner dialogue and thoughts, we actually end up speaking aloud other people.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"And I suspect that you have lots of those thoughts and just give me some examples of them.\", \"So that\\'s what we call an automatic.Yeah, so let\\'s put a couple of those down in this box.\", \"Okay, in the automatic slot box, and they are what ifYeah.\", \"What if What else?get stranded.I can\\'t do it.\", \"And then there was this image about the rainstorm and you don\\'t have any shoes on.\", \"Yeah.\", \"so forth.\", \"What should we put down for that?sort of lost.\", \"Yeah.Mm hmm.\", \"And then we\\'re going to put another box there\\'s a sort of a chain of events here.\", \"The event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety.\", \"And so if you\\'re thinking like this, it makes sense that you\\'d be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"So let\\'s put those in here.\", \"This is the emotion sparks They are much shaky.\", \"You said?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Quite a fear.\", \"Yeah.\", \"If we\\'re going to write that fear on a zero to 100, scale and zeros, none at all and 100 is the maximum anyone could ever get.\", \"Where would you be at this point?AD pretty high.\", \"Yeah.\", \"It\\'s gotten higher though, I suspect.\", \"Oh, yeah.\", \"This point is in 18.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then you had some other feelings inside?breathe.\", \"Stomach any lobster.\", \"So yeah.\", \"So a lot going on here.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And a pretty high level of distress.\", \"Yes, right.\", \"And then we\\'re going to complete this loop.\", \"Putting a box we\\'re gonna call behavior.\", \"This is how you actually acted when you\\'re in the situation.\", \"So what did you do?\", \"If you had these thoughts and you had these feelings,And what was it like for you when you were going to the pharmacy and driving there?Okay, yeah.\", \"So in this case, she actually did go to the pharmacy.\", \"That year, maybe it isn\\'t damage to the steering wheels.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah, I hope not.an escape route, if you would?\", \"So usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as a model.\", \"For many of these situations about driving and feeling, yes, the usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it.\", \"Okay?\", \"And so if you do avoid it, then what happens?Better relief, the emotions calm down now, right?You don\\'t have to worry about it.\", \"So that\\'s what happens for a single episode of this anxiety.\", \"I\\'m wondering though, if we look at the the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief, overall, as far as managing driving, what do you think it does there?it.\", \"Okay.\", \"So in a way, it decreases your confidence over time.\", \"I think so.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I think suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things.\", \"And what\\'s that belief?\", \"Yeah,I can\\'t do it.\", \"So it really comes back to this thought I can\\'t do it.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And he can\\'t do it.\", \"You don\\'t do it.\", \"Right.\", \"So here\\'s this, this chain of events, events, trigger thoughts.\", \"We call them automatic thoughts, and then they influence your emotions.\", \"He\\'s feelings you have and then that influences how you handle the situation.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"Okay.\", \"Now let\\'s think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this.\", \"So let\\'s take a look at these thoughts.\", \"Do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you?\", \"Yeah, okay.\", \"I mean, an example.So for some reason, we don\\'t know exactly why.\", \"But the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you with actually making change in this.\", \"But you do have some differences in the way you think about driving.\", \"That might be something that we could begin to work on in our session, we might, for example, check it out, what\\'s the chances of someone slamming into you?\", \"Okay, what\\'s the chances of you being stranded out there on highway and even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home?\", \"So these are some things that we can begin to do.\", \"So I\\'m going to mark here, we could work on these thoughts, okay.\", \"And then by working on the thoughts, we might be able to help you reduce the emotions, but there are also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that Would be nice to be able to calm yourself down in situations.\", \"So we\\'ll have some, try to build some skills to manage your emotions.\", \"And then on this behavior side, one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up.\", \"And again, build your skills to do it.\", \"And I can see that that causes a little bit of edginess here, what would you think?\", \"Well, I\\'m glad you gave me that feedback.\", \"That\\'s an example by the way of me wanting to hear from you about the way you\\'re responding to what I\\'m saying.\", \"I certainly wouldn\\'t want to make it worse.\", \"Okay, but it cause you too much anxiety.\", \"Uh huh.\", \"And what we\\'ll try to do is pace it adjust to the level that\\'s right for you.\", \"Okay, so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be, which is to be able to drive to your new office, cross a bridge, and maybe even, you know, drive those couple hours to visit your son.\", \"Right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So what do you think?that could be really nice too.\", \"So that would be our goal.\", \"Yeah.Hi, Heidi, my name is Dr.\", \"Sarah.\", \"I\\'m one of the emergency doctors.\", \"I\\'d like to have a chat with you about what\\'s been going On how you\\'ve been feeling so we can find out how best to help you.\", \"Would that be alright?\", \"thanks.\", \"So everything we talk about will be confidential unless I think that you\\'re at risk of being seriously harmed or someone else\\'s, or they are being seriously harmed.\", \"In that case, I\\'d need to tell someone so we could make sure that person is safe.\", \"Is that okay?So, it seems like your mom\\'s pretty worried about you.\", \"But I\\'m curious.\", \"Are you worried or concerned about anything at the moment?Yeah.\", \"How\\'s your mood been recently?Why?So how have you been spending your time filling up your days?What thoughts?You think about that?Do you think about how that could happen?Which one?Have you made any plans about actually going in?what stopped you from going there?Do you think about how you could get to the bridge?\", \"Um I know sometimes when people have a feeling crap and struggling with stuff like you are, they can do other things to hurt themselves, like burning or cutting.When was that?Have you ever done anything else to hurt yourself?it to the have thoughts about harming anyone else?Assess for disturbances in perception that can be auditory or visual.\", \"It\\'s also important to assess the level of protection and supervision that the family offers.\", \"caregivers are able to provide for the young person and what other protective factors there are,How are things at home?Do you have someone you can talk to about what\\'s been going on how you\\'ve been feeling about these thoughts about wanting to die?Have you had anything alcoholic to drink today?What about other drugs slot?\", \"pot I six to see other people\\'s prescription drugs.Any questions for me?\", \"Thank you so much for talking to me today.\", \"I appreciate it.\", \"I\\'m worried about some of the things you\\'ve told me and I\\'m especially worried that you might be at risk of hurting yourself.\", \"So I\\'d like to ask one of my specialist colleagues, john to come and have a chat with you.\", \"He\\'s a mental health nurse.\", \"So he specializes in talking to young people who\\'ve been struggling with their mood or at risk of hurting themselves.\", \"Would that be okay?It is normally about half an hour, but it can take a little bit longer.\", \"Can I get you something to drink while you wait?I saw the smoking sign outside and I like this.\", \"How are the signs working for you?That\\'s really really good.\", \"So how\\'s the job situation coming along?Why?\", \"Why were you late?first Why don\\'t we put a list on the door to tell you You know what you need to go to work?\", \"You know, don\\'t forget any of your paraphernalia.\", \"So you\\'re making your lists.\", \"Are you checking them twice?But are they working for you?\", \"And I noticed your yoga mats here.\", \"Have you been using it?It\\'s good to see and your desk is so organized.\", \"I\\'m loving this right.look at what I have for you.\", \"I brought use a trays to put all your files in.\", \"So what do you think of that?What\\'s your color?Oh yeah, you would not You\\'re the artist.\", \"Okay, we got a pen for you.\", \"And we have a you could put all your pencils over there.\", \"You could put them right in here.\", \"And how about your, your school search?\", \"How\\'s that been coming along?You can keep them on the calendar.\", \"The date,like you miss the deadline.Remember, we talked about that last week to dimer.\", \"That\\'s cool.\", \"That\\'s cool.\", \"So we give you two hours a day.\", \"That\\'s more than enough time for you to play Warcraft And whatever you do on internet.\", \"How\\'s that sound?\", \"Yeah, and we\\'ll help you.\", \"It\\'ll help you focus.\", \"Just little bits at a time, one step at a time.\", \"That\\'s why we have the lists.\", \"That\\'s why we have the calendar.\", \"That\\'s why we have the notebook.\", \"These are all helpful hints.\", \"They are there tools in your toolbox.\", \"And things are looking rosy looking better, more exciting, right?Absolutely great anchors.\", \"I\\'m so proud of you.\", \"You are getting there.\", \"But we are seeing changes.\", \"So maybe we should check on the some veterinarian.\", \"What you what you need for school.okay.\", \"Great.I noticed the signs gone.\", \"How\\'s the smoking situation?You didn\\'t?Oh my goodness.\", \"Oh, it\\'s wonderful.\", \"Oh, you must feel fabulous.Nice.\", \"Imagine all the money you\\'ve saved.It\\'s good.\", \"It\\'s good.\", \"It\\'s excellent.\", \"And how is the job situation?Because you went at the wrong time.\", \"I\\'m sorry to hear that.\", \"Well, no, you know, you\\'ve got to do a bit of research to make sure you go on the right time.\", \"And did you check the list on the door before you left?The list on the door?\", \"You forgot already?\", \"Remember the door?\", \"What are you supposed to do before you left the house?\", \"Okay.\", \"You know what, I\\'ve got another helpful hint.\", \"Here.\", \"Well, you\\'re this knew what you\\'re gonna do.\", \"I\\'m gonna put this on the door.\", \"Every time you open the door, you\\'re gonna hear the sound and it\\'s gonna remind you look at the door make sure you have all the stuff you need for your outing.\", \"Serious See, you can you could you could jazz that up.\", \"I\\'m sure you could do something but you know you\\'ll hear the sound it\\'ll trigger something look at the door look at the mirror look at how great you look.\", \"And to help you be successful.\", \"Christmas every day.\", \"Lovely.\", \"So, so that\\'s another a little tool for you to use.\", \"How\\'s the research going for your schooling?Okay, when\\'s the application date?Before I go, we\\'ll get into that.\", \"And we\\'ll make sure that your applications in what do you think?Okay.\", \"You\\'ll make sure you do it.Great.\", \"How\\'s the list?\", \"Your list been going?Excellent.Nice.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And have you been writing on your calendar?\", \"Wow, it\\'s filled.goodness.\", \"Hey, why don\\'t we celebrate?\", \"Three weeks not smoking.Has it made you rethink your entire job in the profession?you\\'re fearful of this happening again.And how you may handle it?\", \"what may happen?So just to make sure, I understand your Report.\", \"So they were engaging in these behaviors.\", \"And your report, just what precipitated the them being broken up.Alright, let\\'s, let\\'s take a look at the habits, right.\", \"So, in CBT, we like to evaluate evidence and try to look at the facts as we understand them.\", \"And really, we want to scrutinize and carefully review the facts and the evidence and hold a light to it and try to figure out what\\'s going on.\", \"Right.\", \"What would have happened with this family if you hadn\\'t work, no one intervened?So they all be together.\", \"And you feel like, right now.\", \"He\\'s saying with them being a part.\", \"That sounds good.\", \"Is that fair together?you have a tremendous amount of power And if you misuse that power, you could devastate families.\", \"That\\'s maybe what you You think happened to you?\", \"So going back to what would have happened to them, let me just step back there for a moment.\", \"They would still be together without your intervention.\", \"And that could be a positive.\", \"What about consequences that maybe were negative?You made the report because it\\'s your responsibility, but also you had concerns about their welfare.\", \"If you could go back and do it again.\", \"would you change anything?So you don\\'t know if you made a good decision or not.\", \"And further, you question your ability going forward to make decisions.\", \"Hi Kylie.\", \"How you doing today?So the marijuana has real value for you that you don\\'t want to see going.and at the same time, you would like this job.\", \"So I could see how this would be you know, a pincher.Have you been treated for anxiety before?You take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety.So and you may not be able to answer this question, but if you didn\\'t have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana?Hmmso you\\'re excited about the job?really tell me about?So it sounds like your real passion for this type of work.And really, the big obstacle here is this marijuana?Yeah, it\\'s a predicament.\", \"You\\'re kind of weighing both sides of this right.\", \"Now.\", \"I\\'m wondering.\", \"Do you have Do you think you\\'d have like a physical craving for the marijuana?So you\\'re really using it recreationally and as an anti anxiety agent?So if you were I know you didn\\'t have great success before therapy, to combat anxiety, but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job, which seems like you would really like do you think you\\'d be able to stay with the marijuana?You would need to see results ?would having the job that you\\'re passionate about reduce your anxiety ?you\\'re frustrated.\", \"Marijuana is illegal.At the same time, it\\'s the reality you\\'re living in.until then you still need to address this dilemma?So you have choices here, right.\", \"You can continue to use the marijuana and not take the job.\", \"And that seems like something that has some advantages for you, but some, some disadvantages, right?Because you would really like that job.So where do you think you are in terms of making this change?\", \"Do you feel motivated to take some steps toward it?So you definitely, definitely need it?So you can\\'t give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety?That\\'s that\\'s key to you to make this change.But at the same time, that would be ideal, because then you could take the job.So with anxiety reduction, your chances of stopping marijuana increase, and then you could take the job that you wantIs that the outcome you would most want?So here\\'s what I\\'m thinking.\", \"And let me know what you think about this.\", \"When you come back next week, right?\", \"What if we start looking at this anxiety?\", \"When we start, you know, I start treating anxiety.\", \"We\\'ll see if we can get it reduced.\", \"And kind of work from there.\", \"Because maybe when you start to feel if that works, and that anxiety starts to abate, it sounds like it\\'ll just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage.What kind of timeframe Are you on in terms of taking this job?And when would they drug test you?And when did the last time you use Marijuana?To see what I\\'m getting that ?So you\\'re fortunate in the sense that the turnover is highBecause it gives you an opportunity to apply later on.\", \"So do you feel like you can invest in that plan?\", \"Let\\'s work on the anxiety.\", \"See what happened with the marijuana.\", \"See if we can Reduce your usage of it or have you stop that altogether?\", \"And then kind of move towards this job?Right.\", \"So next time you come in, we\\'ll start talking about the anxiety.\", \"And let\\'s see what we can do about that.\", \"We\\'ll kind of move from there.Sounds good ?Thanks, KylieHi Kyle, how have you been ?Not too good?So you\\'re struggling with the decision between two options you perceived as negative, right.\", \"Now we\\'ve discussed the marijuana usage before was just probably the root of this problem.\", \"Right?But it sounds like you didn\\'t really want to explore change this time.So let\\'s focus on this decision then.so the decision is between a couple weeks of  community service what kind of community service?Or $1,000 fine?And do you have the thousand dollars?Do you see any value in either one of these options, which is all become negative?So let\\'s talk about what\\'s important to try to help you make this decision.\", \"Really what you\\'re going to have to determine is, and what I want to explore is the importance of keeping the money.\", \"Right, because that\\'s really what this comes down to.\", \"You You keep it and you do the service, or you spend it and you don\\'t do the service?So you could you could say that it\\'s about the importance of keeping the money rr you could say it\\'s about the importance of avoiding the community service.So let\\'s talk a little about that.\", \"What How would you say on a scale of one to 10, where 10 is very important.\", \"How would you scale keeping the money?So keeping in mind, that\\'s, that\\'s very important to you.\", \"So that scenario would be would lean more toward completing the community service.Well, let\\'s look at the other side too.\", \"How important is it for you on a scale of one to 10 to avoid the community service?\", \"So we know it\\'s a nine, right to keep the money?How to avoid the community service ?So, as you\\'re talking, it seems like you\\'re leaning toward or maybe you\\'re leaning toward completing the service.\", \"Even though you\\'re not happy with either choice, right?That might be the least objectionable.When do you have to make this decision by ?And you go back before the judge on FridayOnce you weigh some of the factors with the way this importance of the money versus doing the community servicelet\\'s meet again just before maybe on Thursday.\", \"Okay, let\\'s meet again Thursday.\", \"And just talk about it and take a look at your decision making process and making sure that you\\'ve made a decision that you can be most happy with.\", \"I know neither option is happy option for you.\", \"They\\'re one that\\'s the least destructive for you the least negative for youThat\\'s sounds like a plan.\", \"?Good, then I\\'ll see there.\", \"Take care.Hi Kylie how are you doing today?I\\'m doing I\\'m doing well thanks for asking.\", \"What\\'s been going on?RightOkay, So you, you applied to two places, and you got them both.\", \"It sounds like both have programs that are really well suited to what you want to do?And you\\'re having difficulty deciding which one to go with.Let\\'s are start to the beginning.\", \"You definitely want to go on for a PhD.\", \"Okay, so we\\'ve established thatSo it\\'s going to be one of these programs either way.\", \"So really, the only question you\\'re really left with is which one?\", \"So oftentimes, these situations we look at pros and cons, right?\", \"Are there any?\", \"Well, it sounds like there\\'s a lot of pros to each one.\", \"Are there any cons to the one ?It will make the decision easier if you had some negatives that for one of the programsthere for the other one.\", \"So in a way, you know, I guess this we call quote unquote, good problemIt\\'s a problem, but you\\'re choosing between two alternatives that are both really positive for you, but it\\'s there is a choice, right?\", \"It\\'s still tough.\", \"And you mentioned before that you had some, in your past you\\'re indecisive.\", \"So maybe we can do in this process is help you build decision making skills or contribute to that ability.\", \"Because whichever whichever program you get into where you choose, you\\'re gonna have to make decisions later on to and probably vary, or maybe some of those will be easier, maybe some of those choices won\\'t be as easy.\", \"So I think this would be a matter of looking at what\\'s important to you.\", \"But you mentioned the research agenda already, or agendas at both universities, that\\'s important, tooWhat are the aspects and maybe not so much thinking about these two universities, but in general, if you had to rank order them, what aspects are really the most important?The research and not a guarantee, necessarily, but some high probability employment?So really what we could do here, if you want to look at these two universities, even though we don\\'t really have any negatives to look at, we can rank these positives.\", \"So it sounds like both have the research that you\\'re looking for that they\\'re both there.\", \"But if you could rank and maybe you don\\'t have this information right now, but if you could rank them in terms of the next most important aspect, which is really how hard Will you work to find a job?\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s kind of what you\\'re saying.\", \"I mean, it sounds like what you\\'re saying?So, do you have any information?\", \"Or is that something you can find?that might allow you to have a difference between them because right now, it\\'s like they\\'re just kind of, they\\'re kind of melded togetherYou know, you have you have really no way yet to separate themSo maybe this can build a bit of a discrepancy that the gap between them so you can say, Okay, this one, neither one is bad, right?\", \"But this one might be a little better for what I want to do.\", \"Does that does that kind of make sense?Similarly, as the I think about it, I know whenever I leave speaking with somebody or some situation, that\\'s right, I always think of all the questions I want to ask, right.\", \"So when you leave here, you can consider some of the other aspects and like, Think it over like really important to me and try to create that distance between them.\", \"So you can look at them as really two separate entities.\", \"Another possibility would be to find out this information, maybe talking to representatives from each university.\", \"If they may or may not have more information about potential pros and they might even have some cons right now.\", \"I\\'m sure they\\'ll present a plate manner but they can let you know maybe some of the negatives.Associated With the other university, or maybe some of the positives that aren\\'t quite as positivesomething that they do well with others, other university doesn\\'t do as well.\", \"So it sounds like this information gathering would really be your next step.One of the things that might be helpful to drive is the importance you place on these different aspects, right.\", \"So kind of clarify, and we can we meet again, we\\'ll talk about this, but clarify your values and what\\'s important to you.\", \"And then that\\'ll help you to kind of rank some of these attributes.All right.\", \"Let\\'s, let\\'s leave it there.\", \"And we\\'ll kind of pick up next time with looking at what we talked about.\", \"Unless you have any further questions.So I\\'ll see you in about a week and we\\'ll pick up thereThanks, Kyle.Hi, Olive.\", \"welcome back.How are you?Ohh I\\'m sorry to hear that.I know last time we talked you  and Kalie had just gotten engaged, and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life.\", \"So So tell me what has happened, what what is what\\'s shifted?I\\'m sorry to hear that.\", \"I know you were.\", \"You were excited.\", \"You were feeling hopeful for change.\", \"And I don\\'t get that same sense from you right now.\", \"In fact, it seems like you\\'re feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless about that situation.\", \"Well, how can I make How can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now.So you\\'ve decided to make a change.\", \"And in fact, it sounds like you\\'ve decided to leave the relationship.\", \"So you\\'re thinking about it.\", \"It\\'s not that you\\'ve committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship.\", \"But correct me if I\\'m wrong.\", \"What you\\'re saying is, you want to make a change, and you don\\'t want this relationship as it is.\", \"Now, what what are you when you think about changing?\", \"What what ideas?\", \"I mean, I guess you mentioned leaving, what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like?Why don\\'t you want to be in this relationship anymore?It doesn\\'t feel right.\", \"So, what would feel right?So the way things are is not right.\", \"It\\'s not working, you don\\'t feel supported.\", \"This isn\\'t the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be.\", \"You really value your self and your well being and in your spirit.\", \"And it sounds like you don\\'t feel like you\\'re taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and Even though things started out well, they haven\\'t turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourselfSo you feeling torned?you\\'re you\\'re torned between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself, and you\\'ve got a lot of mixed feelings.\", \"And you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like you\\'re able to kind of hold that complexity, if you will, that you\\'ve got these strong feelings for this person and you don\\'t feel like this is the good relationship for you.\", \"For both of you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So so then you\\'ve talked a little bit about leaving.\", \"I mean, tell me more about what you thought about.\", \"And when you think about making a change in terms of leaving, what, what might that look like for you?What What thoughts do you have about how you do that?\", \"How do you extract yourself?\", \"How might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace as you said,say more a little more gentle.I heard you say that.\", \"Live it, you know, moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary.\", \"In fact, it\\'s almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like, especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined.\", \"I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier.\", \"And I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that.Yeah.\", \"So you\\'re concerned about your own well being and your own joy and your, your spirit if you you stay and don\\'t make this change, and that\\'s the part that\\'s really scary for you.\", \"You mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break.\", \"And you said that that was a scary thought for you.\", \"And I guess I\\'d like to hear more additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you.It sounds like you\\'re feeling like you\\'re so in, in it just so in the the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it\\'s really hard for you to see out of it.\", \"And an advantage reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence, if you will, that sense of not knowing.\", \"well, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'d love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here.\", \"I just kind of wrote this down really quickly, but on a scale of zero to 10 zero being not motivated at all and 10 being extremely motivated.\", \"how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now?Why a six and not a one?it\\'s important?Well, so so why a six and not a nine?\", \"Or 10?\", \"So it\\'s important to you, and you\\'re not maybe fully confident or sure about the how part.how to make it happen?Well, kind of following up on that on a scale of zero to 10 zero being not confident at all.\", \"10 being extremely confident.\", \"How confident are you that if you decided to take a break from your relationship with Kelly, you would be successful at making that happen?So, so less confident or less confident than you are motivated.\", \"Why a three Not a zero.Mm hmm.\", \"And so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen.Why three and not an eight or nine?So when you think about taking this break, you\\'re also thinking about how she might respond and what she might do and that creates this whole other kind of set of worries.\", \"It, it undermines your sense of confidence onon some level.Yeah.\", \"What do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break.So thinking through an actual plan, like what you would say how long what the boundaries are, might might help you.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then one final question on a scale of zero to 10.\", \"Zero being not ready at all.\", \"And 10 being extremely ready.\", \"How ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break in the, let\\'s say, the next couple of weeks.so pretty ready?And, and you\\'ve spoken to this already a little bit, I believe, but I\\'ll ask you again, why an eight and not a one or two ?So your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know, that you need to do for yourself.\", \"And if you don\\'t, things are not going to get any better.\", \"And that that makes you both motivated and even more ready.\", \"Well, why why an eight and not a ten?So your emotions, your sense of maybe sadness and in grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness and in some wayYeah, and so, another aspect to that to your whole experience says that you\\'re you\\'re grieving.\", \"The relationship isn\\'t even over yet, but you\\'re grieving the dream and the hopes that you had.\", \"And that\\'s a that\\'s a heaviness and certainly a factor and in what you do next?well, if I could take just a moment and make sure I\\'ve captured and understood everything you\\'ve shared with me and I, I know this is really difficult to talk about.\", \"So I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this has been like for you.\", \"You\\'ve been feeling stuck.\", \"And things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you are realizing that Kelly\\'s not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations and your dreams, in a lot of different regards.\", \"You know, that you need to make a change, you want to make a change, and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change.\", \"You know, it\\'s what you want to do, it\\'s the right thing for you.\", \"And you still really care and love, Kelly.\", \"And you\\'re also concerned, kind of on an outer level, about your business, about your community, about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup.\", \"In order to make this more manageable, you\\'re thinking maybe in terms of smaller change, like taking a small break, as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you\\'re pretty ready.\", \"You\\'re somewhat You know, you\\'re motivated.\", \"And then maybe a little less confident.\", \"But you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan, that that might help you feel more confident.\", \"And that\\'s certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if that\\'s alright with you.\", \"I\\'d be happy to hear your ideas, maybe even share some suggestions with you about a possible plan.Is that alright?Thank you very much for your time.\", \"I really appreciate it.Nicole, how are doing today?Doing well.\", \"Thanks for asking.\", \"What brings you into our agency today?feeling anxious every time you go to work, what type of place to work.Work for insurance company and how long have you been feeling anxious?\", \"there?Have you ever had anxiety like that?\", \"A previous employer or any other place?this is somewhat familiar, exciting.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"Tell me about things I,what is it that happens when you try to interact withOkay, so you have an office have separate offices.\", \"And you find yourself maybe isolating a little bit.\", \"Yeah,So what is the what is your experience of anxiety when you\\'re kind of?\", \"I\\'m sure there are situations and diaries, more or less have to interact with other people to limit your experience of anxiety.Well, let\\'s cover both.\", \"Let\\'s start with what type of situations triggers itDo you ever have a desire to leave?\", \"Like if you\\'re in a group just to kind of exterior?And how distressing is this for you?\", \"I mean, obviously, you\\'re here.\", \"So it must be some level of distress but how disruptive is it to your functioning?So meetings and presentations in particular trigger.Can you tell me a little bit more about the physical symptoms?\", \"You mentioned your stomach hurt, when you feel anxious?\", \"Is there any other any other symptoms going on?\", \"You could feel physically,So when these anxiety episodes are more intense, like when you when your stomach hurts, and you have other symptoms, Are you worried about it happening again?\", \"Like, are you worried that those symptoms are gonna occur again, that makes you have more symptoms?Tell me about the meetings that you have.\", \"You mentioned that you have meetings you have to go to expected.\", \"How many people be in a typical meeting?so five to 10 how often these meetings scheduledRight, so somewhat unplanned.So for the ones that are planned, you get anxious in advanced welcome.All right.\", \"So the meetings triggered, generally not being isolated in the office kind of triggers this anxiety.\", \"Right.\", \"But there\\'s other times it sounds like we\\'re not anxious when you\\'re isolating the office.\", \"How would have hungry anxious now?\", \"So really, it\\'s when you get up for work and start thinking about the work day, especially if they\\'re meetings, right?\", \"That sort of starts to,So you suffer the anxiety advance of these plan meetings?\", \"How about the unplanned meetings?\", \"What\\'s your experience of those?So both really causing say that\\'s really troubling if you\\'re sufferingAll right.\", \"What I\\'m going to do is because I\\'m going to schedule you to come and see a counselor here, okay?\", \"pi b, maybe later this week.\", \"Okay, that\\'d be okay.\", \"That\\'ll work.\", \"So I\\'ll take you out to the front.\", \"We\\'ll get you scheduled will be treated later on this week.\", \"What you told me it\\'s been very helpful.\", \"I want to thank you for coming in.How are you doing today?I\\'m doing well.\", \"Thank you for asking.\", \"I understand you\\'ve been having some symptoms that are bothersome to you.\", \"Can you tell me about what?\", \"What\\'s going on?So you\\'ve been having anxiety, maybe having thoughts about possibly losing your apartment?\", \"Yeah.\", \"So tell me more about that.sure they really received your yeah your payment.Right.\", \"Do you find yourself like acting on that thought, like, say specifically that thought with the straightener.When you say everything what what do you mean?before you leave.\", \"Yeah, your apartment.\", \"What do you do when you come back?So if you need to use for instance television, to plug it in and watch it and then unplug it immediately or only before you leave, before you leave, so you leave it plugged in while you\\'re there.\", \"When did you first notice the anxiety?six months ago?how it start out?to the start that to start with the door locks.And you still do that now, do you check the door several times?So how do you do that to to get up and look at it and see the slot and then go sit down and think about it come back or do you operate the mechanism back and forth?For a while.\", \"Yeah.\", \"When this up thought ever come back and have to go check it again?Do you have kind of a checklist in your mind for when you leave your apartment do you do?\", \"Like, unplug everything in roughly the same order?\", \"And check everything is so order.Alright, so you do have kind of a list in your mind of what has to be unplugged.\", \"Yeah, make sure it\\'s all unplugged.\", \"And how about when you lock your door from the outside when you\\'re leaving?\", \"Do you check that?So you\\'re you\\'re checking the door, you know?\", \"Plugging various items that may create heat.\", \"you\\'re careful with you\\'re paying your rent.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So, fear and anxiety surrounding losing the apartment in some manner.\", \"How is this affecting your daily life?\", \"Sometimes,It\\'s just quiet causing some problems.\", \"Getting places on time.\", \"Yeah.How about your level of anxiety or worry?\", \"How high Would yousay that is?It\\'s troubling for you.?If you think about from when it started, it started out sounds like with a few thoughts.\", \"Right?\", \"If we say that\\'s relatively low anxiety.\", \"Yeah.\", \"How would what you have now compared to that?Just a little higher, Yeah.But you have noticed it\\'s worsened over?Six months?Is it the most things I have you\\'ve ever experienced?This is the most you\\'ve experienced?Yes.\", \"This is particularly troubling.They said you\\'ve always been said anxious person.Tell me about that.So other than saying you\\'re anxious, was there any diagnosis provided?\", \"Have you ever had any mental health diagnosis?\", \"Just, I guessNot from a provider?Okay.\", \"How about any medical conditions?Have you ever been in a hospital?How about drugs or alcohol, any any usage of those?\", \"Okay, Marsha, so how can I help you today?Okay, so it sounds like a whole lot of stuffs on top of you So you\\'re working full time part time study, and then you\\'ve got your wedding preparations.So Imagin you\\'ve been sweating on this for a while and it\\'s all been swirling around in your headOkay.\", \"And have they said much to you about filing exam?Yeah.\", \"So it\\'s new and you don\\'t like it at all?Okay, well, I\\'m glad you\\'ve come to counseling, because it\\'s good for us to get an outsider\\'s opinion when we\\'ve got so much on our plate, and we confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way.\", \"And you just said earlier that a whole lot of stuffs on your plate at the moment.\", \"Okay.\", \"So I\\'m glad you\\'ve come here.\", \"Here with the clinic We use the ABC model, which is a cognitive behavioral therapy model.\", \"So Marsha, some counselors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use.\", \"And we don\\'t realize that we\\'re using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones.\", \"Here\\'s the least here.\", \"Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment.okay.\", \"Read that one out for meYeah.\", \"You mentioned thatHmm yeah, that\\'s an expectation from your family.\", \"Hmm.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment?How would you put that, in your own words?Hmm.And is that different from what\\'s happening in your life at the moment?Okay, so if number four is an expectation that your family has given that you have of yourself How do you measure up next to number four?Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"Well, what I\\'d like to do is, is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC.\", \"And I\\'ll explain as we go along.\", \"Okay.\", \"So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment?All right.\", \"And, and the consequences, you thinking of leaving uni.\", \"And, and that statement you made earlier about?\", \"Yeah, that\\'s, that\\'s the one.\", \"That\\'s the crucial one, and I\\'ll explain it shortly when I get up to the board.\", \"Okay, I think I\\'ll put it up there now for you so we can work through that.\", \"So Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier And the kind of decision that you\\'re thinking about is That\\'s right okay.\", \"So it\\'s important that we consider the jump from here over to here.\", \"And the kind of thinking that you\\'ve been swirling around in your head affects the consequence.\", \"And you\\'ve mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit.\", \"And you put that in your own words.\", \"What are your words before?It\\'s really important for us to consider that kind of thinking, hmm.\", \"Okay, Marsha, it\\'s good that we\\'ve got those things on the board.\", \"And what I\\'d like to do now is focus, stepping out a bit from your situation and looking, looking at it from another point of view.\", \"To me, it sounds like you\\'ve, you\\'re doing a whole lot of things really well.\", \"Can you list all of the things that you\\'re doing really well?And all of you other university subjects?And you\\'re succeeding in all of those things together?You\\'re juggling it.\", \"And it\\'s a lot on your plate at the moment.\", \"But it sounds like you\\'ve been able to cope up until this point of the one exam.So, would you describe yourself as successful most of the time?Yeah.\", \"And what\\'s the evidence for that?Yeah, that\\'s right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So how do all of those successes compared to that belief that you\\'ve written that I\\'ve written on the board for you?Yeah, that\\'s right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And all the evidence is there.\", \"All of the subjects that you\\'ve passed in first year, and now second year.\", \"year round, full time job.\", \"That\\'s a success.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s great.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Good.\", \"Okay.\", \"Well, what I\\'d like to do is get you to write that on the board to dispute that belief.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Would you do that?Well done last That\\'s a powerful statement.\", \"What kind of decision goes along with that?Good.\", \"Okay.\", \"Knock that on the board first.Alright, that\\'s good.\", \"Good.\", \"Okay.\", \"So you\\'ve made a bit of a decision, haven\\'t you?Okay.\", \"Tell me about it.\", \"Does it feel like okay?Okay.\", \"Why is that?Okay, yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And we\\'ve talked about all your successes.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So it\\'s hard now to believe that top statement that I\\'m not good enough.Okay.\", \"And so, this idea about staying at uni.Okay, good.\", \"Okay.\", \"What I\\'d like you to do is to keep saying that statement.\", \"I am good enough to say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day, so that you build up your confidence, because it\\'s going to take some time to reprogram you confuse it or up here with that kind of positive belief of about yourself, rather than carrying around that other belief.\", \"And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years.\", \"And so it\\'s going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system.\", \"But you\\'ve made a great start here today.\", \"So congratulations.So today\\'s the dayYeah.\", \"And minister asked you this as you start to enter into this, is this familiar?\", \"Is this a familiar territory?Very familiar would you say?Sure.\", \"Yeah.\", \"How old would you say those thoughts are like that what you just said do you did you notice there was like an urgency to it they kind of went one after another after another after another like like one led to another another I\\'m, this is going to happen when I get there, then this is going to happen with me.\", \"And how old is this whole little  I don\\'t mean those exact words.\", \"But kind of mmaamma ?Okay.\", \"So this has a history.Would it be fair to say that what you have been doing is sort of turning over your life to that, whatever that was.\", \"And you\\'ve come in here.\", \"We\\'ve been working now for these weeks.\", \"Getting ready for this moment to try to create a space in which something different can happen.OkayOkay, so now we\\'re up on or right up on where the action happens.\", \"Like what do you do when you have thoughts like what you just had?\", \"Because you\\'re not there yet.\", \"We\\'re not yet actually in the situation where those things are happening yet.\", \"But we are right here where those things are being conceived with me on this?Okay.\", \"So what can we see this sort of kind of slow this down and watch it?\", \"We\\'re about to do something and here it comes.\", \"Could we take Can I just do something I want to I want to do something.\", \"In terms of creating a history.\", \"I want to create a history right here, instead of cap something like what this would.\", \"What does how the mind works?\", \"Hmm, could we do something kind of odd?\", \"You\\'re gonna play so let me do something.Okay, okay.\", \"I\\'ve got a pen here.\", \"It says something.\", \"Here\\'s what it says it says.okay.\", \"What does it say?Okay, we just did it twice.\", \"You suppose if I come back in here next week, we sit down I said versus say, What?\", \"What do you think and saidAnd next month?How about next year, is it possible.\", \"We just did like 15 seconds.\", \"Is it possible next year, that might come to mind if I said this thingBut as long as you\\'ve struggled with this with the way the mind works, what do you think is going to happen as we come to this day?exactly, if that\\'s if that\\'s the determine, determine if that\\'s what we\\'re going to turn it over tomean, we\\'re, we\\'re never like inside Letting that run your life is what brought you in here.\", \"Think of all the cost that it\\'s produced.\", \"So let\\'s see if we can do something different.\", \"I got a ticket ticket a moment to sort of get in touch with how old this is.\", \"And the cost associated with me on this  yeah.\", \"This pen goes?Mary Had a LittleIf I go to the mall, Okay.\", \"World is working as it should.\", \"Mind is working perfectly.\", \"It\\'s doing what minds do.\", \"That\\'s not your is that your enemy?is it?Okay.\", \"So here\\'s what I\\'d like to ask.\", \"We\\'re about to get up and go do this thing.\", \"We agree.\", \"And it sounds like your mind is engaged.\", \"We did it to find Mr.\", \"anxiety, right?\", \"So it\\'s like we\\'re here And we\\'re right on this pivot point where we\\'re going to do something different.\", \"And here\\'s the thing I\\'d like to ask you.\", \"It\\'s different, but With regard to that, would you be willing to do this and as you go, you can tell me what\\'s coming coming up.\", \"I want you to actually watch your mind go as it constructs those scary futures and just notice it.\", \"Like, sort of like the way you carry something that\\'s fragile.\", \"wants you to just to set a notice.\", \"Like it\\'s not your enemy, and it\\'s not your boss.\", \"It\\'s your mind doing its thing.\", \"Would you be willing to sort of do it that spirit?\", \"Let\\'s see what\\'s there.\", \"This is kind of watch it go.\", \"Yeah, good catch.\", \"So even that, even that thought that came up, as I said that, let\\'s do this.\", \"Okay,How is anxiety.You go there thinking what\\'s gonna happen?what\\'s going to happen ?Okay.\", \"That\\'s surprising.\", \"You\\'d be thinking this.\", \"This is an old thought.\", \"It\\'s, it\\'s where you started.\", \"I mean, it\\'s how you\\'ve been thinking.But well, let me just that ask you this terms of the truth and that truth means different things.\", \"But in all these years, you\\'ve been thinking things like that.\", \"Have you actually lost it?And then once I\\'ve been able to test it to see if it\\'s really trueso far is appeared as as far as you know, this is just a thought.So well, you know, be one thing.\", \"It\\'s worth noticing that and something that for us to kind of hang on to when we go there that when your mind gets on you there that you remember, this is just a thought it\\'s not true as far as you know, from as far as we know, correctly.Okay.\", \"No, not true.\", \"Can I do something that\\'s a little odd, just a little silly to kind of look at this in a different way.\", \"we\\'re gonna have to do something different.\", \"We\\'re not going to get anything different.So give me a cartoon character that to like,Okay, Donald Duck.\", \"So suppose these thoughts were actually something that was like what kind of thoughts would come up if you go to the mall?\", \"It\\'s what\\'s gonna happenOkay, so your Donald Duck says bad Well, first, you know, the thoughts are similarly ridiculous.\", \"I mean here you sort of turning your life over to things that you don\\'t know are true.\", \"And that could just be silly thought about what kind of thoughts would come up there could  we actually go there and in mentally, I could Do you sort of have your thoughts being a Donald Duck horse just so that you can see them as something that\\'s silly which may be able to give you a little bit of freedom from them because you know what happens if you just turn you know, turn your life over huh?\", \"versus the result of a misspent youth.\", \"What other kind of thoughts Yeah, like if you goI just want you to sort of hang on to that a little bit when it really gets up on you so that you can remember, these things are not true as far as you know.\", \"And there\\'s, it is kind of a silly thing to allow them to do what they\\'ve done.\", \"And so we\\'ll just you tell me what they are.\", \"If you can\\'tdo it mentally in your head, I\\'ll say it out loud.\", \"I can probably say most of these thoughts.\", \"Donald back wise, would you be willing to do it that way?never mind.What would you saySo, what\\'s inside this decision?If you could settle them down just to to the two major ones, what would be the two major alternatives that you have here?\", \"Okay.\", \"Which of those is more important you think?Okay, so it seems like if you do one, you don\\'t get the other and if that\\'s really true, are there things in there where you could do bothYet it does does take time but not forever.seems like you\\'re kind of almost anxious when you talk about it here.I don\\'t know.\", \"Maybe you just need to follow your heart here is make a choice.\", \"But how long have you been sitting on this fence?\", \"It\\'s obviously it seems like you\\'re sitting on a fence.Is there any other way to do it other than just the Nike solution?\", \"Just do it?Maybe we\\'re just not thinking about it broadly enough in an open enough way.Oh, what\\'s inside this choice, I guess?Even as you say that there\\'s a sort of sense that we\\'re entering into a kind of chattery world do you feel as though you\\'re kind of getting into space?like if we were to just do it metaphorically Like, how close are your thoughts about Am I doing the right thing if we use distance as a metaphor for how close to Have a sense thatYeah, yeah, exactly.\", \"And that, is that a pretty familiar place to be?Right.So and not just in this area, right?without without any other decisions and choices.\", \"So it\\'s just worth noticing that, you know, that\\'s kind of how your mind works.\", \"Probably trying to help you out here, but it\\'s doing something that\\'s probably pretty familiar.\", \"But what would happen if we kind of just sort of noticed more openly, what your minds doing and also just what\\'s showing up for you and in your body and your emotions?\", \"We look at the sec Nice.\", \"Notice the kind of almost holding like this decision has been made now.So come back to it now and just sort of watch your mind kind of come up like this and see if we can just kind of watch it.\", \"There.\", \"Okay, so you do have a choice to make.\", \"There\\'s only one.\", \"I mean, life is finite, don\\'t get to do everything.\", \"Right, right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And that\\'s a little scary.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And so what does your mind start saying to you?Yeah, exactly.\", \"So just before don\\'t grab that.\", \"So provide them close.\", \"Just didn\\'t notice that.\", \"Okay.\", \"And would that be okay, to have that sort of sense?\", \"I don\\'t know if I made the right decision.\", \"Like, what\\'s inside that?\", \"Would it be okay to have that thought?Yeah it is.And could we sort of open up it is a little scary.\", \"We make choices you do open doors, and you close others.\", \"And even that sounds a bit scary.\", \"Is that Okay.\", \"There\\'s something supposed to happen here when you make career choices, is it not supposed to have any scariness to it?So let\\'s see if we can just kind of open up to that.\", \"But that\\'s okay too.\", \"You\\'re not doing anything wrong here.\", \"It\\'s not an indication something bad is happening here.Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an answer.\", \"biotic four, eight, and that should help with the ear infection.\", \"But in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he\\'s had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.\", \"That\\'s really a big problem.Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections and kids is actually smoke exposure.\", \"Are you smoking?Well, the fact that he\\'s having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke and so what can you tell me about that?I really need you to quit smoking, both for your health and for Aiden.\", \"Did you No smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here also things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities like dental cavities, behavior problems, asthma, other upper respiratory infections.\", \"It\\'s really putting him at a lot of risk.\", \"In addition to that kids of smokers end up smoking themselves.\", \"Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?\", \"Well, now\\'s the time to quit.\", \"It\\'s really gotten to the point where you can\\'t keep smoking, not only for him, like I said, but also for you.\", \"You\\'re putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema for oral cancers for heart disease for all kinds.\", \"Well, there\\'s all kinds of things you can use.\", \"Now, it\\'s not as hard as it used to be.\", \"You can use nicotine replacement.\", \"There\\'s patches, there\\'s lozenges, there\\'s gum, there\\'s the inhaler, there\\'s nasal spray, we can talk about medications.\", \"You can try Chantix, you can try Ziban, there\\'s quit smoking groups you can go to there\\'s hotlines, there\\'s no reason why you shouldn\\'t be able to quit.\", \"This is really important.Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?I really need you to tell me that you\\'re going to quit smoking.\", \"This is really important.Okay, well, I think you really need to think about this seriously.\", \"Like I said, it\\'s really putting yourself and your child in danger.Hello, Maria, it\\'s nice to see you.Fortunately for me, I hear that a lot.\", \"So we\\'re going to be talking about ways to manage your blood clots and options for treatment.\", \"But first I\\'d like to check in on a few things.\", \"The first is you\\'re smoking.\", \"You were to half pack at during your last visit and we talked about how important it is for To quit, I\\'d say it\\'s even more important now that smoking is associated with DVT.\", \"So, have you quit?So deep.\", \"Do you remember our conversation from our last visit?\", \"That\\'s when I give you the information about quitting smoking and the contact number for tobacco treatment specialist.And why is that?Well, we\\'re on the same page then because that\\'s exactly why I\\'m talking to you about quitting smoking, because smoking is a major risk factor for DVT.\", \"Even if you even if we treat you now if you don\\'t quit smoking, I\\'m afraid the blood clots will return again.Hello, Maria, it\\'s nice to see you again.\", \"Hello.Unfortunately for me, I hear that a lot.\", \"So we\\'re going to talk today about how to manage your blood clots and some options for treating.\", \"But first, I wanted to check in on your smoking status.\", \"In our last visit, I recommended that you begin to think about quitting, and I\\'d be interested in hearing your thoughts.Talking about smoking with me as hard for you.So when it comes to smoking, you feel that other people want to tell you what to do and make your decisions for you.\", \"You don\\'t feel heard or respected?Well, I just want to say that I am very glad you decided to come in today.\", \"So we can take care of this blood clot because blood clots are very serious and I know you\\'re concerned.\", \"As your provider, I have to be honest, and say that smoking can cause blood clots.\", \"But hopefully some of the information I give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking.\", \"Now, having said that, I know my opinion, is not the deciding factor.\", \"Quitting smoking as a decision only you can make.would it be okay with you, if I share some information about smoking and blood clots.\", \"And I can tell you what I know and then we\\'ll see what you think.\", \"So, what do you think?You seem surprised and a little more aware now of the smoking risks?So Maria, I\\'d like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking.\", \"So on a scale of one to 10 with one being, you don\\'t think it is at all important that you quit and 10 being you\\'re ready to quit today?\", \"Where would you put yourself?Why Four and not a lower number.So having a better understanding of how smoking adds to the risk of blood clots, increases your desire to quit.What else if anything, makes quitting important to you?the possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upsets you, in addition to your health,So it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children.\", \"It\\'s obvious that you\\'re a good mom.\", \"And if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear.So let me ask you a slightly different question on that same scale of one to 10.\", \"How would you rate your confidence to quit?So you are not feeling very confident right nowSo you\\'ve been persistent and trying and haven\\'t been successful yet.\", \"Still, you you set a two and not a one.\", \"I\\'m curious about that.Sounds like you really feel like you let yourself and your children down.\", \"And that\\'s hard to accept given how much you love your kids.So what what do you think Santa and to think about your smoking?So you know it would be best for you and your children if you quit.\", \"If you had the right support and tools to manage this addiction.\", \"If you believed you could do it, you wouldYou quit for two months when you were pregnant with tail.How did you do with them?So you were able to quit on your own for two months.\", \"That\\'s impressive.\", \"Have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or

asking you more emotionally oriented questions as part of this part, the intake all right.\", \"Some of the topics we\\'ll be covering are sensitive for many people.\", \"And you may not want to talk about it.\", \"That\\'s okay.So if I stumble upon one of those topics, you know, I discuss it, just let me know.\", \"And we don\\'t have to talk about it.If it\\'s an area that you don\\'t want to talk about right now, but you want to talk about later, we can talk about later.\", \"Okay.\", \"Does that make sense?So, how are you referred here to our agency?Do you feel committed to counseling?Why did you say they,Alright, so there\\'s someAnd you think they might not be there at all?Fair enough.\", \"So, I want to talk about what we refer to as the presenting problem.\", \"And I

identify?\", \"Good talk about?Anger, okay.So, um, and objects are the target of some, some physical and angry behavior.\", \"Yeah, but not people.\", \"So do you view anger as a problem you want to

process.\", \"So that\\'s fantastic.\", \"What?\", \"Tell me about what\\'s been going on this week?Tell me about it.Great.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Oh, nice.\", \"Nice.\", \"happy to hear about that.\", \"And then I don\\'t remember I\\'m trying to think from last time, like any Allen updates or Yeah, nice things going, Okay, good.\", \"I\\'m happy to hear that.\", \"And then I guess the other thing that I wanted to, you know, talk with you about I know that we, you know, kind of had mentioned it briefly.\", \"But today kind of marks the kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for us like so then over the next, you know, three sessions, we\\'re going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together.\", \"And I\\'ve been feeling that way too, because it\\'s like, it\\'s hard to, it\\'s hard to want to bring that up, because it\\'s really, it\\'s been really just great working with you.\", \"And so I really don\\'t want to see that come to an end.\", \"But I thought one of the things that\\'s really important is maybe just to get us starting to talk about and again, we don\\'t have to do it all today but just at least get a starting to talk about, you know, some of the changes that you\\'ve made, things that have gone really well for you.\", \"And really maybe kind of recap like how it is that you\\'ve gone from like almost like binge eating daily to almost now you\\'re not at all and kind of, maybe we can kind of talk about how that\\'s gone.\", \"Because I think the other thing that\\'s really important is not only the things that you\\'ve done in terms of like, how things have gotten better for you, but I also want us to start thinking about to like, okay, what\\'s going to happen when we, you know, kind of get to the end of our work together and, you know, beyond so like in terms of like, how will kind of how you will kind of keep the work going.\", \"And so, I\\'ve kind of thought, you know, like, I feel like, I\\'m kind of being like a wet blanket here.\", \"You\\'ve had a really great week, and now I\\'m bringing up our kind of departure.\", \"But I think it\\'s really important to kind of mark that mark that transition, and also to market to by having, you know, things go so well.\", \"I think it\\'s really important.\", \"So I guess the first thing I want to talk about is, I guess I\\'m pointing my my pad of paper because it\\'s like it\\'s so filled with just all the different things that have occurred for you, you know, over the last several weeks, and I think the first thing that\\'s really notable to me is I really, really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom because I know that that\\'s been so hard for you.\", \"And it\\'s been so painful, you know, the way that she\\'s treated you in the past.\", \"But that you know, I guess I\\'m even getting kind of emotional talking about because it just been so rich, the transition you\\'ve made in terms of the way you\\'ve engaged in a more genuine way and allowed her kind of back into your life and it seems like that that\\'s been, you know, really vital to your you know, like getting better.\", \"So what what\\'s you know, in terms of like, from your perspective, kind of what\\'s that been like for you?\", \"I\\'m sure like, Right.\", \"Right money.\", \"And also to I think along with that, is that kind of the strategies, I think that you\\'ve, you know, my hunch would be is that some of the strategies that you\\'ve used, engage your mom in a more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respects in terms of like, some of the other relationships that you\\'ve had, you know, especially, I know that you and Kathy have gotten closer, and even the fact that you\\'ve allowed yourself to kind of, you know, connect with somebody else, like, you know, with Alan, you know, I know you were talking with me the other day about some other friends that you\\'ve, you know, met and people that you\\'ve really got a little bit closer to so that\\'s been really exciting.\", \"Yeah,Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So then, then, kind of from, from your perspective, again, you know, we\\'ll talk more about this in, you know, as you mean, I realize I\\'m kind of putting you on the spot, but as you\\'ve kind of thought about or thinking about it.\", \"Maybe you can think about it.\", \"To even from now on to the next couple of sessions, but just starting to think about like, what is it that you\\'ve really done that you really feel like has been really, that\\'s really helped you make changes in the way in which you\\'ve, you know, managed your food or your binge eating.bro.\", \"No, I\\'ve noticed that as well.\", \"And it seems like that that\\'s been one of the important things that you\\'ve done.\", \"It\\'s really helped, you know, with the changes that you\\'ve made.\", \"What else feels like that?\", \"I mean, you know, I mean, obviously, that\\'s been really important, but what are the other things that you\\'ve noticed in terms of like, you know, how it\\'s been goinggrades are good.\", \"No, you know, things like, like we\\'re really in a good space.\", \"And I think the other thing too, I was aware of that we, you know, that you\\'d mentioned to me in particular last time was that and I didn\\'t get a chance to talk with you as much about it.\", \"So I think we had so much to talk about last session, but I was really struck by the fact that you It seems like you haven\\'t been as body conscious as you have been in the past.\", \"And I didn\\'t know if you\\'ve if you\\'ve noticed that.right?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Cuz I know like initially and even like, there have been times even along the way.\", \"When you\\'ll make, like, you know, I didn\\'t feel like it looked very good, or I felt like something felt really tight on me or, you know, I just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me, but it seems like that, that as we\\'ve kind of moved along that there\\'s really been I\\'ve really noticed a real kind of a little bit of a shift in the way in which you\\'ve kind of been regarding yourself.\", \"And it seems like it\\'s been a little bit differentOkay, but so I\\'m going to go ahead and make you talk about it anyway.\", \"But what did you do in order to be able to get those comments, though, to stop?\", \"Because obviously, I think you did something really significant with her.\", \"Yes.Yeah, yeah.\", \"Well, you know, and that\\'s really not uncommon when you have, you know, it\\'s funny that just even like, not, you know, like, big, big research had, but it seems like that that\\'s pretty consistent, that, you know, kind of, like, you know, mothers to daughters who become mothers to daughters, like sometimes it\\'s kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like, you know, kind of criticality about, you know, shape and weight and, and, you know, some, you know, really proud of you that you, you know, kind of had the courage to address it with her directly and just let her know how you feel because, you know, I think, you know, as a parent, I know that you owe it Like, you know, I always want to try to do the right thing, you know, and I always, you know, I don\\'t purposely want to inflict pain on my children, even though my daughters would suggest that I probably do.\", \"But in general, I don\\'t.\", \"That\\'s not my goal is to be, you know, harsh and critical.\", \"In fact, I really was, you know, try to really be helpful.\", \"And I think most parents try to do the right thing.\", \"But I, and I think maybe your mom just didn\\'t realize the degree to which that really bothered you and how much that hurt.\", \"And in many respects, how much that kind of really drove you to, you know, really, you know, take it out on yourself, so to speak.\", \"And so for you to have the courage to bring that up, I think was really helpful.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"So I really think that that made a lot of differences, as well as, you know, kind of reaching out to others and again, in just the open expression of your feelings, so yeah.\", \"So yeah, I think the things that we\\'re doing like now, I think I\\'d really like to see us kind of continue to, you know, obviously, you still are doing a lot of really good work in terms of like the things that you\\'re talking about and, but yet, I\\'m also aware that you know, as we\\'re over the next couple sessions, we kind of keep doing a few of these things kind of wrapping up.\", \"And then our last session we can more or less, kind of formally, you know, say goodbye and talk about kind of like what the next steps are and, you know, some things you might want to be paying attention to or things you might want to, you know, be mindful of, but we\\'ll get there so yeah.\", \"Does the feeling itself of not being prepared interfere with preparing?Alright, so your ability to concentrate and do the hard work of preparing is affectedAlright, so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing all this goes on right up until you\\'re getting ready to presentso let\\'s talk about that let\\'s go into the actual day a present so we have a successive work coming in it\\'s interfering with your ability but it\\'s distressing for you.Now these presentations are in class?\", \"So it\\'s you\\'re in you\\'re in the classroom.\", \"Do you write the only one to present in that classroom is it rotate through several PV?All right, well, let\\'s choose the last time you presented that classes as a template.\", \"What was the order to go in there?Okay.\", \"So for this example, let\\'s say you\\'re through the second.\", \"Okay, so you\\'re sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting.\", \"What\\'s going through mind that?So in that moment as you\\'re seated, you\\'re not really watching their presentation as much because you have these strong or somewhat strong physical symptoms.\", \"You have your heart racing a bit is sweaty palms.\", \"You\\'re zoned out.\", \"Have you ever felt the need desire to, like, run out of the room?Yeah, so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room like what?\", \"What symptom?And what thoughts are going through your mind right then like, so let\\'s take that kind of severe moment.\", \"When you\\'re, you\\'re, let\\'s just say still before the presentation, okay?\", \"So you\\'re sitting at the desk and your heart rates elevated.\", \"And you\\'re not focusing on what they\\'re doing.\", \"You\\'re zoned out your anxieties high.\", \"What was going through your mind right, then?So you\\'ve already failed.Are you embarrassed that the professor or Other students will see that you were really anxious?Okay.\", \"So, so better to be thought ill and had to leave because you\\'re saying.\", \"to have a severe anxiety for that buddy.\", \"And then they can very embarrassing.\", \"That would be a very undesirable outcome for you.So as you\\'re debating that thought, because that\\'s coming to your head, and you\\'re thinking I just need to, yeah, gotta get out here.\", \"What happens there, so we\\'re maybe What, 15 minutes before we present?\", \"So tell me about that.\", \"So you have that thought you want to flee,Have you ever had to run out?and you presented then you presented Alright, so you you survived.\", \"One of the more stressful presentationsThat was very, very tough on you.\", \"What happened on that particular day?So the some of the thoughts are you wonder if they can see how anxious you are you wonder if you\\'re gonna do poorly on the presentation,So they might, they might think less of you as a person.Yeah.\", \"So there\\'s a number of concerns that kind of going through your mind in that moment.\", \"So when does this start to turn around so you start presenting is 20 minutes you initially get up there and get your presentation up on the The projection monitor.\", \"Yeah.\", \"When does it start to turn the corner?when you receive the grades.So does that intense anxiety that you\\'re having while you\\'re presenting last all the way?Okay, so so the sort of next big drop off for symptoms would be when you\\'re done with  the presentationAll right, then.\", \"But then there\\'s this other worry of now we have to see what the grades are right?So the thought is going through your mind is I\\'m gonna receive a bad grade.Well, how can I help you today?\", \"And how long has this been going on for?I see.\", \"Perhaps we can start by getting a fairer understanding of what\\'s been happening.\", \"What is the main problem for you?\", \"I Understand, and what sort of work do you do?And how\\'s your sleep?do you get sleepy in the daytime?Are there any other physical symptoms that are causing you problems at the moment?muscle aches all over your body.\", \"any symptoms?You feel that there\\'s an infection running through your system?I see.\", \"Is there any other reason you think your symptoms might be caused through an infection?\"], \"Patient\": [\"I think I want to eat healthy.I want to completely cut out fast food.\", \"I want to have more set meals and I just want to eat healthy food.\", \"Okay.I think I at least needs to go to the grocery.\", \"Okay.\", \"No, not lately.\", \"I\\'ve just been grabbing food at work, or going through fast food on the way home.\", \"Okay.Like, I just haven\\'t had the energy or desire to go and I\\'ve also been been working a lot trying to save up money for the baby.\", \"Finding the time might be hard.\", \"Okay,I used to go every week on Sunday.\", \"And I used to already have a list in mind before I went,That would probably make it more likely for me to go.\", \"I don\\'t have to be at work until the afternoon that day.\", \"So I can maybe go asleep and a little bit maybe at like 10 o\\'clock on Sunday.Well, lately when I haven\\'t felt like doing things that I really need to do, I\\'ll give myself a reward.\", \"And I know that there\\'s this great bakery on the way.\", \"So if I tell myself, if I go to the grocery, then I can stop by the bakery on the way home, then I may be more likely to go.yes.Call me, Dorothy.Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency.\", \"And they treated me by putting this tube down my throat.\", \"And I tried to, to tell them and gesture at them that I don\\'t want this tube down my throat.\", \"And I just hope that never happens again.Well, not really.\", \"And because I was gasping for air and in the state I was, but I\\'ll tell you what, I\\'m really worried that this won\\'t happen to me again.\", \"I don\\'t want that to be anymore.\", \"I\\'m, I\\'m okay to to pass this.\", \"Well, I have congested Part failure.\", \"And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly.\", \"So I was living in my soul, the ambulance brought me in to the emergency.\", \"So they that was how they were treating me.That\\'s correct.Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don\\'t want the tube butI guess not.\", \"And, you know, I\\'ve had that three times already.\", \"I don\\'t want to go through withYes.\", \"I don\\'t want it anymore.I guess because I was short of air.\", \"I had a hard time breathing, right?\", \"So they tried to, like, I\\'m going to use the word save me.I I guess so.\", \"But I\\'m okay with dying.\", \"Okay.\", \"You know, like I says, I\\'ve lived a good life and if it If the good Lord says that it\\'s my time, I\\'m okay with that.\", \"And you wouldn\\'t put it toThat is correct.\", \"And, but you know, what, doctor?\", \"How can I be assured that my wishes are respected, so I don\\'t get this tube down?All Thank you.\", \"I\\'m I was so concerned about that and yes, I I think I will rest now because like I say, that was a horrendous experience.\", \"And he says it won\\'t happen again.I\\'m I\\'m feeling fine.\", \"My mood is fine.\", \"I have no no problems.I think I am enjoying life.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yes, I am enjoying life to the to the best I can.\", \"Certainly, Oh, yes.\", \"Oh, look at medication, just not the intubation.No, no, no, I like I said, the good Lord knows when it\\'s my time.Yes, and I have no problems with that.I don\\'t think so.would it be for a long time?Yeah, that would be okay with me.\", \"Okay.\", \"And ifYeah, I would be okay with that.\", \"Yes, yes.\", \"It doesn\\'t sound invasive to me.No, I just needed to be reassured that that it won\\'t happen again.\", \"And and yeah, I\\'m, I know that on my chart.\", \"It\\'s there.\", \"Yes, yes.\", \"And that\\'s all I need to hear because I was concerned.\", \"Okay.\", \"okay.\", \"So if I change my mind, I can I will talk to you.\", \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll change.Um, that\\'s it.\", \"I\\'m beginning with an ass but I can\\'t remember what it is.You don\\'t want I always carry this paper with me because I can\\'t remember the name.\", \"So okay.yes.No.That is correct.No, I don\\'t No, no.\", \"No, I never had the opportunityNo, I don\\'t take any of those.\", \"I\\'m living in a convalescent home for the last six months.\", \"I used to live in my own home.\", \"And six months ago, I\\'m moved to a convalescent home.I would really prefer my own home.\", \"But just trouble with my breathing sometimes, right?It\\'s okay.\", \"Okay, I really have to adjust.\", \"Like I say, if I had my druthers, I\\'d go back but I guess I have to learn to adjust to this right.\", \"Okay.Oh, you answered my question.\", \"I was so worried about this tube.\", \"Thank you.So, basically, it\\'s been getting a little bit worse since we got married.\", \"We got married about a year and a half ago.\", \"And, you know, the the woman that I married, I thought we were both kind of independent people.\", \"And I thought that we would kind of go our separate ways or thing like we used to college, but it\\'s kind of gotten to the point now where it\\'s like, I just want my own personal space and I I don\\'t want to be left alone sometimes.total four or five years, married for a year and a half.I guess kind of once we got married after that, it seemed like, you know, we were spending all of our time together, which, you know, at first was great because we\\'re newlyweds, you know, we love spending time together and everything, but I guess probably about, you know, six months to a year after we first got married, it\\'s kind of, you know, progressed to the point where, you know, now it\\'s just kind of becoming like a burden that whatever I do, she\\'s always there with me.\", \"We\\'re always spending every waking moment together and sometimes it\\'s just nice to have My own personal space is freedom, you know.It kind of Reminds me of how it used to be, you know, like, she said, we\\'ve been dating for four or five years and, you know, back then it It wasn\\'t a problem, you know, she could go out and do her own thing I could go out and do my own thing to not have to worry about each other but now that we\\'re spending every moment together, you know, it\\'s just I\\'m always worried about her she\\'s always worried about me and you know, when when I do get the chance to go you know, hang out with some friends or something like that.\", \"It always feels like, you know, I\\'ve pressure on me because I should be with her.\", \"She shouldn\\'t be there with me, you know, and I feel like I\\'m doing the wrong thing by trying to be independent try to go do things by myself.\", \"I feel guilty.\", \"I do.this a little bit after.\", \"So, like I said, probably the first six months to a year it was it was really good.\", \"But then, you know, reselling is kind of a burden.\", \"You know, just always spending time together and trying to make amends and try not to get into fights because we\\'re always spending so much time together.You don\\'t seem real certain.Yeah, it\\'s been a couple, especially earlier on, which is nice, you know, just, you know, getting to see old friends and you know, our old college friends, like, of course, we attended, you know, events together and like seeing old friends and everything like that, but there\\'s been, there\\'s been a few times, you know, not, not more than I can count on both my hands, but there\\'s been a few times where I\\'ve, you know, gone out and just had, like, you know, a guy\\'s night or something.just getting out of the house is basically the hardest part.\", \"You know, just finding a way to ensure That, you know, it\\'ll be okay.\", \"I\\'m going to be back home later on in the night that she doesn\\'t need to worry about me, you know, if I have any trouble or anything pops up that I need her help, I\\'ll let her know.\", \"And, you know, just knowing that I love her and telling her that I love her and making sure that she knows that I\\'ll be back.\", \"But you know, sometimes it\\'s hard because she just gets upset when I tell her that I\\'m leaving and she doesn\\'t want me to go and she would rather me stay or even take her with me.\", \"And you know, I don\\'t want to be the only guy that shows up with my wife.\", \"You know, everybody else left their wives at home also.\", \"So I don\\'t want to be the odd man outtried twice.\", \"Yeah,That\\'s not good.Well yeah.\", \"mean, we\\'ve been doing it, you know, the past couple months, but it seems like every time we do is you know the same result it\\'s her getting worried about me and you know me trying to find a way to assure her that it\\'s gonna be okay and you know that we\\'re so married we\\'re still in love, you know everything like that, but, you know, it\\'s just, I really want my space and it seems like sometimes I just can\\'t get out of her crib.Yeah, absolutely.\", \"You know, a lot of my friends normally go out during the week because you know, they have their families and everything to take care of on the weekend.\", \"So, yeah, I could definitely go out tonight during the week.I think we could try that.So you know, usually I\\'ll go get dressed I\\'ll let her know where I\\'m going you know, give her my cell phone number you know somebody else\\'s phone number in case my phone is off.\", \"Just basically tell her what we\\'re going to do you know whether we\\'re going out to to a pole or you know, going to watch some sporting event or something like that.\", \"No, I would tell her what we\\'re doing, you know, just so she knows and knows where she can find me.\", \"But then after that, it seems like as soon as I assure her of what we\\'re doing, and when it\\'s happening, when I\\'ll be home, everything like that, it just seems like all the progress I made towards the front door kind of gets pulled back a little bit because like, she doesn\\'t want me to leave, you know, I can see in her eyes that she\\'s not very happy about me leaving her.\", \"And that kind of makes me feel guilty, you know, because I don\\'t want to leave her alone.\", \"I want her to be more independent.\", \"I kind of want her to, you know, if I\\'m going out, I would like her to go out as well.\", \"You know, she says tons of friends.\", \"You know, we both have friends.\", \"We both have our social circles.\", \"And she\\'s kind of it\\'s frustrating when I can\\'t go do my thing, because she\\'s always got to be with me.Most of the time, right?\", \"Do you know, sometimes I just can\\'t get over the fact that you know, my wife at home who\\'s upset at me, and that makes me upset.\", \"You know, it\\'s just a matter of finding the balance between, you know, my independence and her, you know, doing her own thing because I would like her to do that as well.When I come home, usually things go back to normal.\", \"I mean, we\\'ve definitely had our exchange of words after a few times me coming back.\", \"But most of the time it goes back to normal, which you know, it\\'s fine.\", \"We\\'re very loving, affectionate couple.\", \"So that\\'s awesome.\", \"But you know, most the time it\\'s just overbearing.Absolutely not.\", \"No, no, I love Sarah you know, the five years that we\\'ve worked together been great, you know, it\\'s it\\'s just where we are now as opposed to where we first were, and when we first got married, it\\'s it\\'s changed and you know, I would just like some independence just like to be on my own sometimes.\", \"And I guess I don\\'t always relay that well to her and she doesn\\'t understand why I want my space.\", \"I want to go hang out with my friends, but I\\'ve been trying to explain to her that, you know, it\\'s, it\\'s a two way street.\", \"It\\'s not just all one way and so we have to work on these issues.\", \"And you know, that\\'s why we came to you.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Most of the time, I\\'m very good at responding to, you know, making sure that she knows I\\'m okay.\", \"Making sure that she\\'s okay.Yeah.but at the same time, like when I\\'m out doing my own thing, you know, I kind of want that privacy in that, you know, just being in the moment you know, because I know when I get back home, from back with you and I\\'m, nothing\\'s changed because I\\'ve always been with you like we\\'re still married.\", \"But when I\\'m out with my friends, and you know, I\\'m getting a couple phone calls during you know, the night over the course of the night and it\\'s having to deal with my wife and having to make sure that she knows I\\'m okay and everything like that it it gets a little frustrating.\", \"It\\'s a little, I

to courtsoon.\", \"And I know that I\\'m probably gonna have to go I\\'d like treatment or something like that, but I really just don\\'t want to.\", \"So I just, I\\'m just coming here becauseI don\\'t know maybe I can like get out of it if I\\'m gettingsome type of treatment.\", \"But yeah,Yeah.\", \"I mean, I feel like they\\'re probably gonna make me like go to like rehab or something like that.\", \"And I don\\'t want to do that.I don\\'t know.\", \"I really am not sure.Yeah kind ofI mean sometimes I\\'ll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like at my

probably just like wouldn\\'t understand it, because we all go out and we get like really drunk andknow.Yeah, I mean, it\\'s making me think that like, maybe I, I need to, like make a change.\", \"I just can\\'t see that.\", \"That\\'s the change I\\'m making.\", \"SoYeah, yeah.Yeah, I don\\'t know what butAm I just not going anywhere ever?\", \"I might not drive as oftenNow that I\\'m likeI\\'d

you know, because I don\\'t watch TV at night, because I\\'m so busy cleaning up and everything.\", \"Maybe I could just take some time for myself, because I did something good.\", \"You know, I just watch a TV show.Probably as I\\'m preparing dinner, if I prepare food dinner, or if I prepare fun food for my kids, but I don\\'t eat it like chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff.I don\\'t know

anything.\", \"It\\'s really hard to admit because I can\\'t imagine that anybody else could understand what this feels like it, it feels unnatural, almost that kind of relief to say it out loud.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"That is part of me that almost feels angry with all the stuff I\\'ve got to do, and I don\\'t feel like I\\'m getting the support that I need.\", \"And it\\'s really difficult.\", \"I feel like I have to do it all myself.Yeah, and it\\'s Huge it\\'s like this little little boy that just needs me to be there.\", \"I\\'m struggling to be there and until want to be there even.\", \"So it\\'s really overwhelming.\", \"Mm hmm.my partner, John\\'s Bay like, he tries, but I think he is getting frustrated with me, too.\", \"He\\'s sensing that.\", \"I guess he had expectations of how I would be and how we would be and how this would be and I think that he\\'s disappointed in me.\", \"And then that doesn\\'t help and so then I sort of feel like I have to do it

what happened was basically that mom, mom, she was just getting really angry at me for Dave again, because you know, we\\'ve been going out for three months and it\\'s time I\\'ve told you before.\", \"Really, really, really doesn\\'t like him.Yeah.\", \"And she was, she had to go in for the drugs again.\", \"And then she was saying, you know that I can do so much better.\", \"And she was just, you know, like, Oh, I really screaming at me and I had to take all of that and, you know, people were just going around in circles in circles.\", \"And it was really, really not not very, not very good that I had listened to her saying that.Yeah, I was because, you know, she.\", \"Well, you know, that I mean, I really like Dave, I think that is really good.\", \"And, and, and, and I would, I would, I would, I would, I would like to keep on seeing him but that she disapproves of him.\", \"And I find it really hard.\", \"It\\'s just proof of him.While she doesn\\'t, she doesn\\'t want me to talk to him.\", \"about it because she doesn\\'t want him to know that she doesn\\'t like him.\", \"And then you know, he doesn\\'t really like her as well, because she thinks he thinks that she\\'s a snob.\", \"And so it\\'s really hard.\", \"You know, I just feel like I\\'m sort of, sort of in the middle and like in between the two of them.\", \"Yeah.\", \"ButYeah, I think I\\'ll be able to give it a practice thisAll right.\", \"What did it do?\", \"I tell you that I had an argument with my mom on Thursday.yeah, an argument with mom and it was really bad because she was just yelling, yelling, yelling in your with about Dave.\", \"I\\'ve told you about Dave before because she doesn\\'t like Dave and she was having a got me for the drug.\", \"You know, cuz he takes the drugs and she was just yelling at me because she doesn\\'t like that he takes the drugs, but the student doesn\\'t understand that.\", \"I mean, I just want to be with you.\", \"And so but because she doesn\\'t like him see, you know, sister, she was yelling at me about that on Thursday,Well, this one, this one, I mean, the argument was, when she was saying she was saying to me that I should leave him.\", \"And she was saying, you know, that I could do a lot better and that I really shouldn\\'t be with him.\", \"And I should just leave she was saying, but you know, and then she wouldn\\'t let me you know, because I wanted to talk to him about it, and she wouldn\\'t let me talk to him about it.\", \"And because I really don\\'t like each other, I just I\\'m really sort of stuck in the middle.Okay.\", \"All right.\", \"So we can spend, we can spend most the next session talking about it.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.Yeah, I\\'m Jake\\'s mom.\", \"I\\'ve seen you at kindy.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah.Well, um, I guess, part of the problem for me is that I really, I feel that I really need to talk to someone about what\\'s going on for me and I don\\'t really, there\\'s no one else in town I can talk to okay.\", \"No, I mean, I think I think it\\'s good if you know if we can, like say hi and stuff, but I mean, I probably Probably wouldn\\'t want to talk to you at kindy about what we do here in case other people hear it.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I mean, you wouldn\\'t, you wouldn\\'t tell anybody other moms, would you?So it\\'s kind of like, we\\'ve got therapy for in here, but then out there.\", \"We\\'re just mums.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah, that sounds good.Okay.Yeah, let\\'s go.\", \"Okay.Which chair would you like me to sit in?\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s okay.\", \"Yeah.Its NiceYeah.My mom dropped me here here.No, she\\'s not here.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"I\\'m like, half an hour 15 minutes, maybe another 15 minutes.\", \"Yeah, I feel better.\", \"Such as the police interview thatlike to go into so much detail.\", \"Yeah.Brown,Oh, yeah.\", \"Yeah, cool.\", \"Okay.\", \"okay.\", \"Yeah, really, it was really hard.\", \"Talk about that stuff.Oh, yes.\", \"So um, so mom was with me.\", \"Yeah.\", \"They came over.\", \"And they were two detectives.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And they, yeah, they just wanted to know everything and it took like hours.Like, I\\'m glad it\\'s over and done with.\", \"I didn\\'t realize how hard it would be to talk about it.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"For some reason I was thinking it was.\", \"It was all over and done with no.\",

know, I\\'ve been back down to a nine lately.\", \"I guess maybe I feel a little better because I\\'m coming here.\", \"And I know, we\\'ll get to talk about it a little bit.\", \"But I guess you know, last time we were talking about me trying to get a job and live full time job.\", \"And I think I just realized last week that it\\'s really hard for me to work full time right now.\", \"You know, I\\'m doing the part time thing with the work program, and they want us to do volunteer work in the afternoon, if we haven\\'t found a full time job by a certain week.\", \"And I just, you know, just thinking about it, and I just don\\'t think I can do that.\", \"I just don\\'t think I can work for eight hours every day.\", \"It\\'s just too much.No, I mean, that makes sense.Well, I mean, I don\\'t really know why it is.\", \"I know I\\'m always tired because I just I have so much trouble sleeping, as I told you before.\", \"It\\'s just It doesn\\'t matter how tired I am, I can\\'t sleep, but it\\'s just I go, I go in the morning, you know, eight to noon, but then in the afternoon, it\\'s just like, it\\'s so hard to keep going on.\", \"It\\'s just such a long amount of time.\",

my depression so much worse.\", \"Yeah, a lot of hard work day.It\\'s hard.\", \"It\\'s hard, but I feel like I\\'m better at that.\", \"I\\'m better at it.\", \"I\\'m already up anyway.\", \"So, you know, I know I gotta get up.\", \"I gotta do what I have to do.Yeah.\", \"Eight to noon.Well, yeah, since I\\'ve been there for what is it eight weeks.\", \"And I haven\\'t found a job yet.\", \"They want us to volunteer in the afternoon and they find us our own place of volunteer.\", \"So that\\'s good.\", \"I don\\'t have to find that myself.\", \"But I guess they want to get you used to doing something for eight hours a day and maybe you have something to put on your resume.\", \"And guess what?\", \"have like a big gap in your resume that doesn\\'t look good either.\", \"So haven\\'t been able to say a work tear even though I didn\\'t make money.\", \"But just thinking about it, it\\'s so exhausting.\", \"And you know, I get out of the work program and I think if I did go to, I can barely make it home.\", \"It\\'s just so all I want to do is go home.I just don\\'t think I can do it.\", \"Like, I just don\\'t think I\\'m the kind of person that can work eight hours a day.\", \"And it just makes me feel like what\\'s the point like, I\\'m going to work eight hours a day.Yeah.Yeah, I have this case.\", \"You know recently where it\\'s a single dad, the mom passed away and I go in and check on him and his son, you You know, things are going well, but, you know, I think the dad has a hard time so it\\'s not like it was before when the mom was there.\", \"Not that I wasn\\'t there before that but you can just tell that like, things are a little different.\", \"But you know, obviously, my decision is that things are going well for the kid, you know, they\\'re gonna he\\'s gonna stay there.\", \"Dad is stable, but I just worried like, is the dad under too much stress?\", \"Is he really taking care of the kid as good as you know, what if he\\'s just cleaning up the house and doing the right things on there while I\\'m not there?\", \"You know, does he have the energy to take care of his kid?\", \"Or is everything really the way I it appears?\", \"Or is there more going on?\", \"I just don\\'t know.Yeah.\", \"And it\\'s like, I can\\'t let it go.\", \"Like, I saw him like two weeks ago.\", \"And I still wonder if I have other cases like that.\",

terrible happens?\", \"And I should have known better.Yeah, definitely.Yeah.\", \"I mean, I think that that\\'s probably true.\", \"Because before I felt fine, and now I just feel like everything\\'s falling apart and not that much has changed.\", \"And so it kind of makes me think that that\\'s probably what\\'s going on, but I don\\'t know how to change that.Such as the police interview thatlike

was just, you know, doing my normal job making reports and everything like that.\", \"And, you know, I made a report about this family that I felt, you know, maybe the children weren\\'t getting quite What they needed, they seemed malnourished The house was really unclean.\", \"You know, I suspected that the parents were using drugs there, and it\\'s just really not a good environment.\", \"And, you know, turns out that the kids were taken away.\", \"And, you know, the family.\", \"It just unlike really freaked out, you know, maybe the kids aren\\'t doing well.\", \"They\\'re away from their

big issue at work.\", \"I guess we\\'re like, everybody knows about it.\", \"And, you know, I just feel like I tore this family apart.\", \"And I don\\'t know if I made the right decision.\", \"And I just, it\\'s like, you know, I used to just, I used to be so confident in what I did.\", \"And now I just feel like I\\'m second guessing everything.Yeah.Yeah, it\\'s making me not like my job.\",

having a good time and then I remember what happened and it just brings me back to that place and I\\'ve just I don\\'t like it.\", \"I know it\\'s uncomfortable.\", \"Because it sucks like this therapy is just like a not getting anywhere.\", \"Like it\\'s just not like doing anything.\", \"So yeah, it\\'s like it\\'s uncomfortable to talk about because it\\'s like I don\\'t know.Well, what I\\'m trying to talk about and I don\\'t know what else like you want me to do.\", \"I told you that I\\'m not good.\", \"I\\'m getting something out of therapy.\", \"I feel like I\\'m being very clear, but I guess I\\'m not.I mean, I\\'m feeling angry that the therapy isn\\'t working.\", \"Like I\\'ve been saying.\", \"I\\'m feeling angry that like, I\\'m still in the place that I\\'m in.\",

getting from you even though that\\'s what I what I\\'m trying to get.\", \"SoIt feels hard.\", \"I mean, the feels hard to say that I\\'m angry.\", \"It\\'s like not a feel it\\'s not a comfortable thing to say or not a comfortable thing to feel.\", \"It\\'s just like makes me likeit\\'s not something I would like ordinarily say to someone that I\\'m angry at them, so feels like, I feel like I\\'m kind of anxious now like even saying, like, I don\\'t want you to think I just like that.\", \"It\\'s like your fault.\", \"It just like feels like I\\'m like, that\\'s something I\\'m really not supposed to say.Really?\", \"I guess.\", \"I don\\'t want to do that.\", \"But yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"It is hard to feel like this.\", \"I feel like I\\'m alone in this therapy that like, I\\'ve been coming here and trying and I\\'m just not like getting anything from you.\", \"Okay, so thatYeah, feels really hard and I want to be able to.I\\'m still feeling a little anxious, but I mean, I think it\\'s better feels better that it\\'s like out there.\", \"I guess that I\\'d like said it and I think maybe that helps.\", \"if I go to work I\\'m going to make a mistake,So I mean, what am I supposed to say to myself?Yeah.I guess I told myself, I have to get to work on time because if I don\\'t, it\\'s going to be even worse.\", \"If I make a mistake, and I\\'m late that it just, you know, it compounds and I guess I would tell myself, it\\'s gonna be okay.\", \"You just have to get through this day.\", \"I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I guess none technically none that have been something I\\'ve gotten trouble for anything like that.\", \"Sometimes it\\'s hard to tell because you know, you don\\'t always hear from people afterwards.\", \"You can\\'t really tell was it a mistake or not.\", \"But I guess none that it had like any major consequences.\", \"Yeah, I guess that\\'s true.\", \"I guess like it Everybody makes mistakes.I\\'m a good caseworker and I need to do my job so I can help other people and it\\'s going to be okay.I mean it feels a little better but it\\'s hard you know so I felt still feel like it\\'s dangerous I might make a mistake but I guess it helps a little bitYeah, I think I probably will because now it will be hard to have those thoughts and not think of you .\", \"Okay, I need to calm myself down a little bit.Yeah.\", \"It did help in the past.it\\'s not gonna work every time.Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.that makes sense because like, if you could just flip a switch you I would only have to have one therapy session.I\\'m gonna have to, you know, hear what my coworkers have to say about what\\'s going on.\", \"I might make another mistake.\", \"Who knows if I\\'m going to find out that something terrible happened to these kids when I go back to work?\", \"I guess a lot of stuff like that.I feel more anxious.\", \"You know, I think about like, what could happen to somebody else if I make a mistake, like kids going to the wrong home or, you know, not being with their parents when their parents you know, we\\'re not doing anything wrong.\", \"And I just feel really like overwhelmed and it gets hard to breathe and I just want to go back to sleep and not have to face anything.And then a lot more lately because I have trouble getting out of it.Yeah, they\\'re keeping me from getting the work and stuff like that.Right now in this moment, probably like a five.\", \"Around the middle.\", \"Yeah, like I\\'m really stressed out but I not like when I\\'m in bed, like I can\\'t get out of bed, that kind of thing.Probably like an eight.Right now probably anxiety.Hi, Thank you.Yeah.Sure.\", \"Um, As you know, I\\'m Andrea.\", \"I am a junior.\", \"I\\'m in the marching band.\", \"I played a ceter sacks.\", \"I\\'m also in the band geek.\", \"I play you know, in the Wind Ensemble in the jazz band, things like that.Yeah.I started playing about 10 years ago, actually.\", \"Yeah, I started on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet.\", \"Finally found the center sacks.Um, you know, just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach, things like that.YeahWell, I have one older brother.\", \"He\\'s about eight and a half years older than me, my parents and I have a Dog.It\\'s a golden retrieverbig boy.Pretty good.\", \"Grades have been pretty alright.\", \"Still like 3.7 ish.I\\'d like to, you know, I\\'d like to, of course graduate high school, hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean, that might not happen.\", \"And then I\\'d like to go on become a doctor, study psychology, you need to come in psychiatrist or something.Yeah.Um, I think a sense of community and belonging.I think those two and respect, respect.Yeah, well, I think community and belonging I kind of related them.\", \"You know, I said I was in the marching band, I really, you know, I really enjoy being in like that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working toward together towards that one goal.\", \"And then in terms of Respect I, I kind of view that as one of like, my major, like roles, like I really do think respect is important and to respect myself and respect those around me.I placed great importance to them.Yeah.yes.Um, sometimes if you just you know, go to the movies go to the beach, like I said, or sometimes we just get together at someone\\'s house, play some board games and hang out.Yeah, sometimes,Well, it\\'s mostly just for for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up, as they say,YeahI\\'d say I\\'m on a not busy month, for instance, I\\'d say about like, two weekends out of the month to three.\", \"YeahThe days that we drink are mostly like I said, they\\'re parties.\", \"So it\\'s more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun and then when we don\\'t, it\\'s a lot more relaxed.\", \"It\\'s a lot more hanging out playing board games, watching the movie.Yeah, definitely.I think of them as as different.\", \"I think, you know, night in playing board games and things, it\\'s meant to be relaxing.\", \"So it\\'s nice to have like that kind of breather.\", \"Versus with a party.\", \"It\\'s a lot more energetic.\", \"It\\'s a after at all, it\\'s very draining.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"But in the moment, it\\'s quite fun to dance and have fun.Yes.Um, it\\'s, you know, when we drink, we we tend to have more fun because I guess we\\'re not, you know, everyone\\'s drinking together.\", \"We\\'re a lot more loosened up and relaxed, and not really thinking about stresses or things like that.\", \"But it can be when it\\'s too much drinking it can be, can be obviously bad.\", \"A lot of times, it\\'ll make make people stupid.\", \"Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that we usually try to be as safe about it as possible.\", \"So we\\'ll like sleep over a friend\\'s house.\", \"And, you know, we\\'re not driving and it\\'s mostly within our friend group.\", \"So we\\'re not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.\", \"But um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they\\'re stupid when they\\'re drunk and can be really stupid.Yeah.Sometimes Yeah.Well, I especially don\\'t like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much, and we have like throwing up or things like that.\", \"I don\\'t.\", \"That\\'s not fun.\", \"Yeah, its not.For me that\\'s happened to me once.\", \"It was the first time I ever drank.\", \"And it was, it was a lot.\", \"I didn\\'t know what I was doing.\", \"I was mixing all kinds of weird things.\", \"And just kind of taking anything anyone gave me.\", \"That didn\\'t end well.\", \"But after that, I haven\\'t, but I do have friends that that still do sometimes.\", \"So I\\'ll end up like having to take care of them or something and it kind of puts it down on my on my fun.\", \"people can get a little sloppy, I guess, like they\\'re all loose, like, with people and corners doing things that should be done in private.Yeah, got it.\", \"I just I you know, have an aunt who is an alcoholic.\", \"So I, I see, like the issues that are involved in I\\'ve seen movies and things I know that junk drives is an issue.\", \"So I, you know, I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like, we can let loose but still be safe, like someone\\'s house or parents at home or something.\", \"But so I like I know that there are dangers involved.\", \"And I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun, right.\", \"in terms of what, in terms of respect?I think, well, in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I\\'m not putting things I\\'m putting things And then that shouldn\\'t be there.\", \"Okay.\", \"And then, but in terms of highways, I am respecting myself I am, I\\'m respecting myself by like, trying to stay in someone\\'s house and like trying to limit my drinking.\", \"So I don\\'t get to that blacked out like that calling up and everything and try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior.\", \"So I\\'m not going to go to some random person I may into I don\\'t know where to do.\", \"I don\\'t know what and things like that.\", \"Yeah.I usually will I start off by making sure that I make my own drink so I know what\\'s in it and how much isn\\'t it so that way I control how much I drink.\", \"So I\\'ll usually just, you know, get one of those.\", \"cups and then make one drink.\", \"And then I\\'ll try to make it last as long as possible.\", \"And I\\'ll be like, Alright, this is my one drink, and I\\'m good.\", \"And that way, I still have something in my cup.\", \"So people aren\\'t going to be like, oh, here have some more like, No, I\\'m good.\", \"I have mine.\", \"And I\\'ll still be, you know, having some to like, let loose a little.for the most part, it works pretty well.\", \"Because like I said, people, you know, if people come asking you trying to pressure me, I\\'ll be like, No, I\\'m good.\", \"I have, you know, I still have some, like, I\\'ll get some later and then never end up getting anything.\", \"But sometimes they\\'ll be like, hey, let\\'s take a shot and everyone\\'s gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot.\", \"And then at that point, I\\'ll be like, Oh, well, maybe I can take one more.\", \"And that\\'s when I start, you know, falling into, too much.\", \"I\\'d like to make sure that I, you know, in terms of respecting myself, my body, I\\'d like to, you know, try to drink less, okay, like a, you know, it is nice to let loose and have fun, but I\\'d also like it to be so, you know, I\\'m not damaging my body and I, like my liver doesn\\'t work by the time I\\'m like, 22.\", \"And, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community.\", \"YesI\\'d say about like, like a six or seven.\", \"Oh, like to work on it.\", \"But, you know, if I get around to it I get around to if I don\\'t I don\\'t.\", \"Hmm.\", \"Um, because I still think it\\'s, it\\'s important.\", \"Uh huh.\", \"I still you know, like I said, I don\\'t want my body try especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your, your social and your schoolwork and things like that.\", \"I know that once I get to college, it\\'s not it\\'s not gonna gonna work out being you know, drinking every weekend and then like, trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam, like, I know, that\\'s not that\\'s not feasible.\", \"It\\'s not a good idea.I think if I made the decision that I was going to for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know I can.It\\'s just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it.\", \"Uh huh.\", \"making the decision in the first place.Um, I\\'m thinking of maybe like, trying to convince my friends without sounding you know, dorky or something, be like, Hey, you know, let\\'s just stay in today.\", \"Like, let\\'s not go out or something.\", \"Or just be like, Hey, I\\'m not like, I\\'m not gonna drink today.\", \"And then even if my friends do like being okay with them, drinking around, not doing it and then then being okay with me, drinking, me not drinking and then doing whatever they want.I think so I think it\\'s, it\\'s very feasible.\", \"I think it\\'s possible.I think so.\", \"That\\'s good.YashYeahYeah, I like it.HiYeahWell, my name is Laura.\", \"I\\'m 17 years old and I\\'m a senior in high school.\", \"Okay.\", \"Well, hopefully go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college.I\\'m not sure yet.\", \"Maybe a few schools in the area I\\'m looking maybe to apply out of state.I might go  for college.Yeah, definitely.Yeah, maybe I\\'m pre law.Yeah.Well, I\\'m on the weekends, I like to hang out with my friends.\", \"Maybe you go to like a party or go to the mall to shop.\", \"Or if there\\'s like a school related event, we\\'ll go to like a football game or something like that.\", \"Yeah.Yeah.\", \"I would say like a moderate amount.\", \"I\\'m not really, really popular or like I have no friends.\", \"I\\'m like normal.Yeah.They\\'re pretty good A\\'s and B\\'s, so I\\'m doing okay.Um, family, definitely.\", \"friendship and belonging.Well, I, I love them so I want them to think well And I want them to be accepting and love me.Yeah, I have one sister.friendship.\", \"I\\'ve grown close to many people that I care about.\", \"So I would like them to be accepting of me as well.Yeah.\", \"Just a sense of like fitting in and like getting accepted.Yeah, kind of.\", \"Umm not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most.\", \"I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like so it looks like I\\'m drinking Even though I\\'m not so maybe people bug me about drinking or something,have one there and pretend you have it.one or two weekends a month.\", \"The most.\", \"No really muchYeah.Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone\\'s house.\", \"Or even if it\\'s not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there\\'ll be like a few beers around.Pretty much Yeah.mostly just with us, but sometimes I\\'ll go to like a close friend\\'s house and like I\\'m close to your family as well.\", \"So Well just hang out.\", \"Like drunk driving?\", \"Definitely, No, I\\'ve never drunk driven.\", \"And I\\'ve never been in a car with a drunk driver.Because I know that\\'s extremely dangerous.Well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment.\", \"So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like, crashes and accidents and things like that.\", \"So I rather not be in that situation.\", \"YeahYeah.No more than two drinks.Yeah, those two.Um, I\\'ve never really been drunk.\", \"So I can\\'t really say that I like that feeling or not.\", \"But it\\'s just I mean, you\\'re just in a good mood.\", \"Yeah relax Um, no, not really.\", \"Like I said, I don\\'t drink that much.\", \"So I wouldn\\'t be able to tell you.\", \"Um, definitely.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I mean, when I\\'m at parties and stuff, and it\\'s getting a little later, some people that drink like drank too much, they start throwing up or they get hurt, or they\\'re really loud and obnoxious.\", \"And that\\'s not fun for anybody.Yeah,  No, I mean, I\\'ve never, you know, been friends with anybody.\", \"It\\'s gotten to like a serious accident.\", \"And so it\\'s just very like obnoxious thing.Um, I know, it\\'s definitely risky.\", \"I mean, I guess we still do it.Yeah It\\'s just there.Um, well, definitely not in my family life because my parents don\\'t really condone, okay, alcohol use.\", \"But friendships, I mean, when I\\'m hanging out with my friends, or we\\'re at a party or something, there\\'s usually alcohol involved.\", \"Yeah.I guess it means this is just there.so it ties in with the whole belonging.It probably will have a very small role, if any, in my life considering I have big plans for my future.\", \"I mean, I don\\'t think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I\\'m studying for school or in college or trying to get off school, things like that.\", \"Yeah, definitely.maybe less than I am now.\", \"I mean, I don\\'t drink much anyway.\", \"So maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon.Yeah definatelyWell, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school.\", \"And once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything bigger.Yeah, definately that\\'s a good thing.maybe five or six.Because it\\'s not something I do not care about it all but it\\'s not something that\\'s just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.Yeah.I\\'m pretty confident that I can, considering that I\\'m not really an alcohol user, per se.\", \"I\\'m not really into that whole scene, so it\\'s gonna be difficult for me.On a scale of one to 10, If I can quit alchohol?maybe like an eight or nine.Yes.Um, probably to stop.\", \"Maybe next Friday I go to I have a drink at all.\", \"Yeah, I mean, I can just tell my friends, my parent, my friends aren\\'t really that pressuring.\", \"It\\'s just like outside people that don\\'t really know that well.\", \"So I could just tell them, Hey, I don\\'t feel like having a drink today.Definitely, I\\'ll have like, all my senses there and I\\'ll be aware of everything that\\'s going on.\", \"Um, health concerns?\", \"I guess I know, alcohol is bad for your health.\", \"So that would be one.Yeah.Yeah, that would be okay.Right.How would you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?Yeah, for sure.I was just planning on playing them that I don\\'t really want to drink anymore.\", \"That was me.\", \"Know, Yeah, I mean, that was my closest friends for sure.\", \"No, I think okay.\", \"Okay.Yeah.No problemI\\'m well how are you?I am here now because I was caught stealing money.Yeah,about a month agolike diagnosing,Sure.25Well, I stole money from a friend of mine.\", \"AndThis was a friendWell, She turned me in.\", \"So we\\'re no longer friends.Well, basically when I was younger, I got I used to get into a lot of fights.my family.yeah, I remember doing it.\", \"Yeah.12 years old.Oh, noI guess the usual I mean, I enjoy And got into some drugs and would use and do stuff like that.\", \"SoI mean yeah.\", \"So kept getting into fights and stuff but yeah, I think my last real fight was when I was about 20.\", \"So yeah.Yeah, yeah.probably every fight that I ever gotten into so many I don\\'t have a numberSo the one girl, she just, I felt looked at me wrong and I didn\\'t like it.\", \"So I punched her in the mouth and continued to do so until she was on the ground and then I still continue to do so.She deserved that.Yes.No.I\\'m apologize but just to appease people so that I didn\\'t get into any more trouble.Yeah.I think I didn\\'t mean he didn\\'t mean it.\", \"It was just to get out of trouble and go on myself.Absolutely.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, yeah.Yeah.\", \"I mean, wouldn\\'t you?Absolutely.\", \"Yeah.No.same thing.\", \"They, I mean, they had more money than me, so why

that I smoke.\", \"Um, so she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you.\", \"So I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it.Yeah, I mean, it\\'s just it\\'s easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you like That\\'s it.\", \"I can spend like 45 minutes with you compared to ours or her nagging me through the week soYeah, I mean, it\\'s covered by insurance.\", \"It\\'s just 45 minutes of my time, butI don\\'t really have one.\", \"Like, I don\\'t think smoking is that bad.\", \"Well, I mean, smoking can be bad, but like it

don\\'t know.\", \"There\\'s like so many good things about smoking.\", \"I get one what really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me like one on one time with the boss.\", \"So like the fact that I can get that time with my boss is make worth it.\", \"Um, I it\\'s just a, it\\'s how I meet people.\", \"So like, if I like, I\\'ll have cigarettes on me, but like, I don\\'t have a lighter and that kind of like keeps me from finishing off the pack.\", \"Because I can finish off a pack a day.\", \"But if I don\\'t have a lighter than, like, I carry the cigarettes around with me.\", \"And then if I see other people are smoking, I can go and ask for a lighter and that\\'s always kind of went away and to get to these groups and I\\'ve just met so many different people from from smoking likeYeah, I mean, like I only do it socially.\", \"So that\\'s Yeah.I mean, yeah, I mean, everyone, everyone knows smoking is unhealthy.\", \"But like I don\\'t, I don\\'t smoke a lot.\", \"Like I only only smoke from time to time and it\\'s mostly just on the weekends.\", \"So it\\'s like, I don\\'t know, occasionally I go by smoker for the weekends, I might have like a cough.\", \"Maybe I get like a heavy cough on Mondays Tuesdays, part of me is gone by Wednesday.\", \"So it\\'s not really that big of a deal.Now.\", \"I mean, like the obviously is unhealthy.\", \"But like one of the things I\\'m trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons.\", \"I think.I don\\'t know.\", \"Maybe like, like a two.\", \"like it\\'d be cool to get rid of the cough on Mondays but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from smoking.YeahI could say probably like an eight or nine like I could I could give it up actually I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn\\'t even crave it but eventually like just seeing all my friends got smoking like I missed that.\", \"So I just started off again, but I don\\'t know if I like if I really wanted to give it up.\", \"Forget I\\'m sure I couldI don\\'t know.\", \"Like, I guess it would It would help to be able to, like explain to my girlfriend that like the stuff that I get from smoking and like you You seem you kind of seem like you get it so like, I don\\'t know, maybe figure out ways to like explain to her the things that I get from smoking to like, I don\\'t know just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself.Yeah.Yeah.Well, no, we haven\\'t really been like we\\'ve been fighting a lot because of the smoking.\", \"So I think like, maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way like I don\\'t ascribe that but like having fights that are productive like that just don\\'t always end like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us leaving the house but like, I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn\\'t last for like days.right yeah, yeah.\", \"RightYeah.right Yeah, yeah, I think that\\'d be cool.\", \"Yeah, I can do it that it\\'s kind of like killing two birds with one stone.Right, right.\", \"yeahYeah.\", \"Yeah, that\\'d be cool.\", \"We can do that.\", \"Right.\", \"All right.\", \"Sounds good.Thank you.Hi Dr.\", \"Grande, about the same.YeahWell, it might be a little worse had you know, I\\'ve been talking about my problems with the perks.\", \"The past couple of times I\\'ve seen you and I don\\'t know I think at work, they might be starting to notice a little bit.Yeah.Well, yeah, because when I take them, I feel normal.\", \"Like, it makes me feel like I can function.\", \"And I feel normal.\", \"But like, definitely last week, my coworker in the cubicle across the way was she was looking at me, she was just looking at me really funny and, and then also, I\\'ve been having a little bit of trouble with the numbers.\", \"I\\'m just not.\", \"I\\'m not on my game the way I used to be.\", \"And I know that there is a connection to the drugs.yeah, yeah, definitely.\", \"It\\'s hard to focus but if I don\\'t do it I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I can barely get out of bed.\", \"I can I don\\'t know, I\\'m completely what to do No, right.\", \"It is not fun.Right.Oh god no.no no no, YeahYeah.\", \"And when you put it that way, she\\'s definitely noticed it and she talks to so it\\'s not like she\\'s if she thinks something\\'s up.\", \"With me, she\\'s going to keep it to herself.\", \"So that would be the reputation piece and then also, the quality of my work.\", \"I know it\\'s, it\\'s not the same, it\\'s a lot harder for me to produce what I used to.Yeah, for sure.\", \"But I can\\'t take detox, there\\'s it\\'s just not an option.that change, like giving up the Percocet.\", \"See, I go back and forth.\", \"I don\\'t know that it\\'s that important.\", \"Well, if I lose my job, that would be horrible.\", \"So maybe it is pretty important.\", \"I mean, it\\'s important that I keep my job.\", \"It\\'s really important that I keep my job, and then it keeps my reputation.Yeah, because to get out of bed, yeah.\", \"Okay.7     8     7.Alright, eight.\", \"I mean, I got to keep it up.Yeah.Okay.That\\'s what I\\'ve been trying to do for how long have I been coming in here?I\\'ve tried I mean, I have really tried.\", \"I know I can\\'t I don\\'t I don\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t think I can do it.Like 0   1 I can\\'t.\", \"I\\'ve been trying.Yeah, it\\'s pretty depressing.I\\'ll leave here swearing to myself.\", \"I\\'m done.\", \"You know that next week I\\'m going to come in and I\\'m going to tell you that I didn\\'t use at all and then like before, I\\'m in bed.\", \"I\\'ve already taken some you know that night.Well, yeah, I mean, I used to I used to with the gambling I guess, I I used to hit Delaware Park, you know, on a regular basis and spent a lot of money and my husband was pretty upset about it and I had a really hard time stopping that.\", \"We Oh yeah, definitely.Oh, God, I would never want to go back to that.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, that\\'s that\\'s a really good point.\", \"I didn\\'t think that I was going to be able to say probably about a to two or three.\", \"I didn\\'t think about it that way.\", \"So I really didn\\'t think I could do it then and it\\'s been, you know, a couple years since I\\'ve even been in a casino.Yeah, definitely.It\\'s so different.\", \"It\\'s different.\", \"It\\'s so different.\", \"Oh my god.\", \"Let\\'s talk about that.\", \"Just like I just find myself popping them in my mouth.\", \"You know.RightRight, Right.\", \"Yeah.OkayI didn\\'t think about detox, but you\\'re right.\", \"It was miserable in that period when I first stopped kind of casino and I felt that really strong urge to go.\", \"And I made it through that, my husband was amazing.Oh yeah, he was really great.\", \"He would sit with me he would talk me through it.\", \"We go to movies sweet, you now he was really encouraging.\", \"Probably be really happy to see me stop using these Percocet too.Okay.Yeah.RightOh, yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"He He\\'s really, you know, upset, by the way, and I\\'m taking them and he\\'s really worried about me losing the job.\", \"I don\\'t see why he wouldn\\'t be able to help me in the same way, I guess.OkayI can definitely do that.\", \"Yeah.Thanks a lot.I\\'m fine.\", \"Thanks.\", \"Well, strange feeling strange for this, but okay.Umm hmm I have I\\'ve not done this before.I\\'m not even sure I am I heard about this place and that you work with women who are having trouble with a relationship and are confused.\", \"And so I thought I\\'d give you guys a call.\", \"And so I\\'m, thank you so much for taking the time to see me.Yeah, yeah, cuz I don\\'t know what to do.That sounds really hard because I\\'m not sure I\\'m very good at sorting things out myself.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, that\\'s a good way to put it.\", \"I\\'m kind of confused about what to do next.\", \"And I have a little baby at home, so I don\\'t I can\\'t think anyway, most the time.Mm hmm.\", \"And, and my boyfriend affects him.\", \"Which is why I guess I guess I\\'m here to talk about him and me and the baby and what we\\'re, you know, how we work together.I don\\'t know where to start.\", \"He and I had been together for about a year.\", \"And I got pregnant right away and we just had this baby a little while ago.\", \"And and before that I was working.\", \"And he and I, you know, we\\'re on and off here and there, we get invites and he disappears for a while then he comes back.\", \"That\\'s kind of what the ears look like.\", \"And I just been getting more and more confused on what to do and recently he did something really that didn\\'t even look like him.\", \"He looked like a different person and it freaked me out and freaked the baby out.\", \"And quite honestly, it freaked him out too.\", \"He didn\\'t he said he didn\\'t know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control.Mm hmm.\", \"Yeah, he came home.\", \"I was a friend come over a man friend, he doesn\\'t like me to have men friends came over to help me with my resume, because I\\'m starting to think about going back to work.\", \"And he had a weird look in his eye and so I kind of, you know, we sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as after right after he left he he kind of just got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was just different than anything that ever happened to me or us together and He just got this weird kind of like he was possessed by something.\", \"And he said he didn\\'t, he would never do that again.\", \"He\\'s he\\'s really good daddy.\", \"And he really helps us out a lot.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And he\\'s, he\\'s, he really helps us out.\", \"And I didn\\'t know what to do with that.\", \"So that\\'s why it\\'s, I guess that feeling that I have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do.I haven\\'t talked anybody for for a year reallyYeah.\", \"Yeah, I haven\\'t my parents live pretty far away and, and I guess he\\'s kind of a boyfriend kind ofI guess the words jealous.\", \"He just really cares about us.\", \"And so I haven\\'t had a chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that will.\", \"What could I do, I used to work and I was kind of looking forward to working again.\", \"He\\'s he\\'s sort of made it clear that I don\\'t need to work because he\\'s going to take care of us he brings home diapers and gives us some money when he\\'s around and so we really don\\'t need it most the time.Yeah, yeah.\", \"Yeah, it does take care of us.\", \"He\\'s, uh, he\\'s he makes sure that I have enough money for, you know, the basic needs in the house and he pays the rent and, and you know, but when I when he\\'s gone and I run out of money, it just kind of that\\'s when I think cut it.\", \"Just wish I could take a little bit by myself.\", \"I just not sure how to go about doing that.And I yeah, and I don\\'t know who to talk to about that.\", \"I try to call him sometimes and make up you know, and say sorry for the fight that we had and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn\\'t.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So I don\\'t know how to do this.\", \"I mean, I don\\'t know what to do next.\", \"Not very good at it.Thanks.\", \"It\\'s really hard tookayyeah, right.\", \"Well, it\\'s, it\\'s funny as you\\'re showing me this, I I\\'ve been thinking, all I\\'ve been doing is focusing on the baby and being a good mom and and, and yet, I\\'m also trying to think about getting a job and I don\\'t know how those two fit together.\", \"And even as I\\'m just saying that out loud.\", \"I\\'m not even talking about taking care of him.\", \"Which is weird that I\\'m not even when I look at this these circles I am looking at mothering and children and finances and that seems to be important yet I\\'m spent I spend so much time thinking about him all the time and right now I\\'m notThese things if the job and taking learning how to be a better mother and might be a might help the relationship so that might beWhat to do about the relationship?\", \"Yeah, what to do about the relationship?\", \"I\\'m not sure what to do with a relationship.I don\\'t even know what to think about that.\", \"I don\\'t know how to.\", \"Yeah, I don\\'t feel like I\\'ve been making any decisions.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And how to balance that with being a mom at the same time, because that sounds really hard.Well, I guess I think initially that I would need his help more, he would need to help take care of the baby.\", \"He doesn\\'t do that.\", \"Now.\", \"So I don\\'t know.\", \"And it be kind of scary that I don\\'t know what that would look like.\", \"So I would have to find some other help to get to be able to go to work even just part time, so I could get some childcare or something.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Somebody I trusted.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I\\'d have to figure out just the timing of that and a job that would fit a schedule where I could still breastfeed and help her with her naps and make sure I\\'m there for bedtime and all those important times, but make enough money that it was worthwhile to, to do it.\", \"Yeah, to be out and working and paying somebody.\", \"That sounds like a lot.Umm Mm hmm.\", \"It\\'s very important to me.\", \"I didn\\'t I didn\\'t think I was I wanted to have children.\", \"And then we did so.\", \"I would like him to be a daddy in that.\", \"Wow.\", \"Just well as I was thinking about him not being around as the daddy and I\\'m not really sure what to do with that.\", \"But the baby the baby is the most important thing right now.I didn\\'t realize that I\\'ve spent so much time thinking about him all the time.\", \"And when we can hear back and does he love us?\", \"And why the heck did he do that that weird thing and why does he care about these other things that he cares about?Yeah, why does he.\", \"And it has nothing to do with what I\\'m thinking about now, which is the baby andagonizing I guess that\\'s what I\\'ve been doing.\", \"I feel like I\\'ve just been hoping and wishing and it seems like all my focus is always so when the baby\\'s crying and I\\'m worrying about him and and and so the baby crying is just it\\'s hard, but but if just now talking about it letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing that I could actually think about why the baby\\'s crying as opposed to why why is he not returning my calls?\", \"or Why did he give me that look, when I you know, talked about getting a job and things like that it\\'s not so interesting.\", \"I need his help with that.\", \"Yeah, I don\\'t need to be worrying about him too.I don\\'t understand what safety planning means.So if he kind of got that weird look in his eye again, which actually I\\'ve seen before, but he just never really did anything like this before.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Okay, so like, if I recognize if I saw that look What to do?\", \"Sounds kind of freaky to think that I would have to keep myself safe from somebody that says he loves me and you know, love the baby.\", \"Sounds a little strange.No, shouldn\\'t have to be  that way.\", \"But I didn\\'t expect him to do what he did either.\", \"So That kind of came out of nowhereYeah, it doesn\\'t seem real.\", \"So I guess, thinking about thinking about that kind of makes sense ahead of time.Okaythat yeah, that kind of captures it all.\", \"Yes.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I don\\'t know.\", \"I don\\'t know where to start.\", \"But I guess that\\'s why I\\'m talking to you.\", \"So there\\'s like a good somebody can help me work on my resume or something like that.Okay.\", \"Okay.\", \"Does that sound That sounds good.\", \"Okay, nice.\", \"Thank you.\", \"I think I\\'ll go get my baby from childcare and well, should we make another appointment or something?\", \"Okay.\", \"Thank you.It\\'s good to see you.I\\'m doing okay.\", \"And you know, things have been settling down a bit, I think.yeah, yes, It\\'s it\\'s pretty pain, you know, had a lot of pain in it.\", \"I\\'ve been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and just kind of trying to keep busy and focus on things that are happening.\", \"I\\'ve been busy with my church duties and with my kids Yeah, yeah, it\\'s been hard to think about myself when I have so many other things that are more way more important than me to deal with.They\\'re doing okay, you know, the little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when I first got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what was going to happen but the older the older kids have helped out quite a bit.\", \"So I think they\\'re pulling together.yeah, I mean, my motto is just to keep moving, you know, moving as fast as I can, trying to get, you know, keep the house clean and be good, you know, with my duties with my church and trying to keep the kids focused on their activities and not to be too focused on what\\'s happening in me and Paul\\'s life because you know, there\\'s nothing they can do about that.\", \"Yeah.No, I, you know, I made time today to talk about this.\", \"I think it\\'s really important to try to figure something out things got very out of hand there.\", \"And so it\\'s, it\\'s, I\\'m looking forward to thinking about what what things I can do.It was terrifying.\", \"I mean, we police were called, you know, we ended up having to call the police.\", \"And Paul was arrested and spent some time in jail.\", \"I had Child Welfare folks crawling all over my house and my mom was upset and neighbors were all being nosy and gossiping.\", \"And it\\'s, it\\'s it was just very scary.right?\", \"I mean, it was, you know, we had people come into the house calling and you know, checking in, are you okay?\", \"Or can you get a restraining order and my mom was trying to get me to move in with her and you know, it\\'s just too many, you know, too many cooks in the kitchen.Yeah, yeah, so I\\'m just really I\\'m not I\\'m not gonna do that.\", \"I\\'m not gonna get a restraining order.\", \"I\\'m not gonna call the police.\", \"It\\'s no he knows where I live.\", \"They were they were throwing him on the ground.\", \"They were holding his arms behind his back and They have their guns and you know that kind of you never know what the police are going to do to a black man.\", \"You never know whether he\\'s going to make it to the jail safely.\", \"So I was I was terrified for him.\", \"And then the next day, you know, Child Welfare call in the house.Yeah.\", \"Because I\\'m a good mom.Yeah, no, no, I\\'ve told my mom that that\\'s, you know, that\\'s a last resort.\", \"And that I\\'m going to be meeting with some folks and thinking about other options.Absolutely.Mm hmm.I think I\\'m most afraid.\", \"You know that something might happen that will be really crazy and really out of control.\", \"And so I\\'ve been thinking about what kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control.\", \"And I\\'ve just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it was came to my mind because he\\'s somebody who we\\'ve talked to before.YeahI\\'m really, I\\'m really interested in telling him more of the truth of what\\'s happening in my relationship he doesn\\'t know about He has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me.\", \"And then he\\'s starting to kill himself and the children.\", \"He knows we\\'ve had some marital problems, some financial problems.\", \"He knows that Paul\\'s had some drinking problems.\", \"So there\\'s some of that, but he doesn\\'t know about him threatening to kill us or that he\\'s been hitting me or his rages.\", \"So I feel like, you know, that it\\'s time to tell them, you know, tell him some of that stuff.He\\'s been helpful before, he\\'s really helped us a lot.\", \"we\\'ve, we\\'ve had counseling with him over the last five years, numerous times.\", \"And he has been very helpful to someone that you trust someone that you have a relationship with, and he\\'s been helpful in what ways is he been helpful?\", \"You know, I think Paul respects him as a man.\", \"And I think he cares about Paul.\", \"So he\\'s not you know, my mom and my dad and my friends.\", \"They they\\'re they\\'re really bordering on hating Paul.\", \"And they don\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him that my pastor has some objectivity.\", \"And I think he cares about Paul,I don\\'t think that he\\'s going to likely go storming into, you know, our pastor\\'s house, Paul.\", \"That Paul won\\'t You know, he\\'s gonna he\\'ll he comes back in at my mom\\'s door and he goes, you know, storming over to my girlfriend\\'s house.\", \"But he\\'s not likely to do that.\", \"Yeah, I don\\'t think you will.Right..to cool offBecause things got so out of control and crazy, you know, and and that\\'s not going to happen again.\", \"you know, you know, my eldest son got involved.\", \"My arm was was, was harmed and things were broken.\", \"He threatened to kill me and he threatened to kill all of us.\", \"And I had to call the police and I had to, you have people coming into my house, tromping through my house, grabbing Paul hurting him.\", \"You know, he called me from jail and how can you do this?\", \"You know, what have you done?\", \"You know, I felt like what have I done?\", \"How can I do this?\", \"all that Fallout.that Paul will know, you know, if he finds out that I\\'ve talked to our minister about this?\", \"You know, I have no doubt how angry he will be.Yes, he finds out about it.It\\'s, it\\'s a risk I\\'m willing to take, you know, I have thought about this.\", \"And it was, you know, things got so out of control.\", \"And I feel like it\\'s time to do something different and to think about how we\\'re going to do this differently.Yeah.You know, I think that things can\\'t continue the way that they are.\", \"I have to figure out something that\\'s going to work for me and for my kids and for Paul.I think my oldest, my oldest son, that would be a really helpful thing for him because he wants to know what he can do.\", \"He wants to do something he\\'s always jumping in.\", \"That\\'s how I got hurt in the first place because he was jumping in.\", \"So helping him identify something that he can do that will keep us safe and to keep him safe would would be a great idea.Yeah, he\\'s becoming a man now, too.\", \"He, he needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe.\", \"Yes.Yeah.Thank you I\\'d ppreciate that.Thank you.Yeah.Yeahanxiety is always really high.\", \"But yesterday was the worst.We were driving.\", \"My dad was driving and I was in the passenger seat and we were in a lot of traffic and that, you know, that already makes me nervous.\", \"I like to be on time.I don\\'t want to be late because then what if I get in trouble.\", \"So it\\'s already kind of on edge.\", \"And then we passed the accident that I guess was causing off the traffic.\", \"And there were two cars and they were like, mashed together like accordions, and there was a tarp.\", \"And I know that under that tarp, there was a dead body, and the car went right.\", \"by it.\", \"This horribleyeah.\", \"Who wouldn\\'t be anxious?\", \"That\\'s like a normal thing because there\\'s a dead body.Who would drive when there\\'s two cars mash together like accordions on a dead body?\", \"That\\'s insane.\", \"You have to be insane to drive.they\\'re insane.I can\\'t see my friends anymore if I\\'m dead.And I get that I have to drive because you\\'re right.\", \"It\\'s like the middle of nowhere.\", \"And I can\\'t just, like, not go places, but There\\'s a lot of puns, Jen.Well, that\\'s helpful.\", \"Thanks.\", \"Yeah, but all these things you keep telling me that I have to do to be less anxious.\", \"They involve like feeling really anxious.\", \"there\\'s no way to like can\\'t you\\'re supposed to like just make it go away.\", \"You\\'re not supposed to make it worse to make it better.That\\'s soo hard.I think it sounds really hard.\", \"It\\'s really hard.Maybe it\\'s just not there.\", \"Same thing that you have to be more anxious to be less anxious.No,  you know thatJenna\\'s  thats not funny.\", \"that\\'s horrible, So you\\'re saying that no matter what I choose, it\\'s going to involve feeling anxious.\", \"Well, I mean, if those are the only options, might as well do the one that\\'s gonna make it eventually go away rather than just be there forever.Yeah, I guess.\", \"Umm not not too good.No, I just got into a fight my parentsWell, I I\\'ve been doing heroin for for a few months now.\", \"And I didn\\'t think my parents knew but I guess they they found a needle in my room.\", \"And I mean they knew what I was doing.\", \"And they they told me that I have to start shaping up and I need to I need to stop doing any kind of drugs because they said they said the next time that they find find any kind of drugs and it\\'s, it\\'s it, they\\'re gonna kick me out of the house.RightWho want to be out there ever?\", \"I don\\'t know who would be.\", \"I mean it would be hard just to kind of stop cold turkey and I know a couple buddies that did that and it\\'s it\\'s not good when you get junk sick.\", \"And I mean, I\\'m kind of stuck because I don\\'t know.\", \"I don\\'t want to be out in the streets, but it\\'s just gonna be so hard.\", \"So hard to giveRight, Right.\", \"I just I mean, I don\\'t want to give it up.\", \"But, I mean, I kind of know I have to.\", \"I mean, I\\'m a young guy, I I couldn\\'t make it outside of my parents house and I definitely don\\'t want to be on the streets.Right.\", \"But to this point haven\\'t been able to.YeahI mean when I first started it was I mean it was pretty freakin great.\", \"I mean the rush that you get from it it\\'s it\\'s just mind blowing it\\'s it\\'s just amazing.\", \"But of I\\'ve noticed recently that like the rush isn\\'t as intense anymore and it\\'s even like it\\'s even kind of started to backfire a little bit where like actually I\\'ll feel all sick without using it.\", \"And I mean that kind of scares me but the cravings are definitely still there.I had before but a minute like there there is no reason to so I didn\\'t try very hard.I did.\", \"Yeah, it was an A it wasn\\'t as bad as as any of my buddies but I definitely I mean I didn\\'t I didn\\'t feel wellYeah, I mean they they do I definitely like I don\\'t hold anything against my parents I got you I have a pretty good relationship with them.\", \"I know what I\\'m doing isn\\'t isn\\'t good for me.\", \"And they they said that they would completely support me they they told me that they have a place picked out where I can go and that they\\'d be willing to pay for it and everything but they said if I you know if I don\\'t meet them halfway then it\\'s just that\\'s it like it\\'s they\\'re done.It isI mean, that you know, I think I think I\\'m starting to come to terms and it\\'s that it\\'s time to stop and it might be good that maybe I\\'m stopping so early.\", \"I know.\", \"I know.\", \"My friends have been doing it for a lot longer than I have.\", \"But I just Yeah, I don\\'t I don\\'t know if the detox gonna work.\", \"I mean, it\\'s, it\\'s hard for me to focus on like anything until sometimes until I get my next fix.right It\\'s tough right now cuz actually my, my dealer lives in my neighborhood.\", \"I mean, he\\'s, I mean, he\\'s just like a few few houses down.\", \"My my girlfriend lives in our community too.\", \"And like, he\\'s he\\'s on the way to her house.\", \"So a girl kind of just maybe pick it up on my way.\", \"And third, third, my bookbag and getting out my girlfriend bit and then maybe on my way back home, I\\'ll shoot up the buddy.\", \"SoRight.\", \"Yeah.I mean, it\\'s like that house is kind of, that\\'s actually where I shoot up a lot.\", \"So it\\'s like whenever it is right, right.\", \"So it\\'s like, whenever whenever I\\'m coming up to his house, I\\'m like, I start start getting excited, you know, like, sir anticipating how how great it\\'s, it\\'s gonna feel the next time.\", \"And it\\'s I know it\\'s like stuck with me I get I get excited when it\\'s as well as youI like I kind of, I just can\\'t wait for the for the next hit.\", \"Now I got passes how since my parents are giving me an ultimatum.\", \"And now it\\'s kind of mixed because I\\'m like, man, if I if I get to do that, and somehow they find out like, it\\'s, it\\'s kind of all over for me.\", \"And then but on the other hand, I\\'m thinking about how How great it\\'s gonna be.\", \"I\\'m just kind of like I\\'m planning in my mind how much I\\'m going to do and what kind of plans we\\'ll have for the rest of the night.It is.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s Yeah.\", \"I mean, my, my definite plan is to go into detox and if the detox works, like, I mean, I think I can be done with it.\", \"But it\\'s just I don\\'t I don\\'t know if the detox can work.\", \"And I mean, I\\'ve never only tried to cut back that one time.\", \"And I mean, I don\\'t know how good I\\'ll be at it.\", \"You know,Right, right.I don\\'t know if I\\'ll go right back.\", \"Like I think if I can get off at the detox actually work.\", \"So with that said, Do I think I could stay off it, I think like, my, I think my cravings will still always be there.\", \"But now that it\\'s like, now that I\\'ve come to the realization that some of the stuff that I can lose if I get caught, I mean, if I can get off it for good, I don\\'t, I don\\'t like I feel back.\", \"It might be hard, like if I run into my buddy or something.\", \"Right.right.I mean, yeah, definitely.\", \"I won\\'t like there\\'s there\\'s so many like, experiences in this house.\", \"That that kind of to feed into the anticipation and the cravings.\", \"I mean, if that doesn\\'t happen, you probably helpPretty soon I think I\\'m supposed to go on Monday after the weekend.\", \"So like three daysrightNo Nono Yeah, if it works, and then I can try.right?rightYeah, I mean there is this is kind of out of the way but I think yeah I could go there\\'s like a like a horseshoe path.\", \"I could.\", \"Yeah, I could.\", \"I could like go up the block and I\\'m like around the horseshoe and then and then I can like turn right and get her house there.Right Right.Um, I mean, yeah, she\\'s she\\'s come over.\", \"So maybe if like, maybe if I tell her that it\\'ll, you know, help me out she can like she can make that walk and I\\'ll be like, it\\'ll be easierright right I if I are walking out of the house, it\\'d be harder for me to actually do what I\\'m supposed to.\", \"So if I can\\'t even leave, and she comes at I might be best, No, no, I, like I worked on the road.\", \"So I just drive like I drive all the way out to the community.Right.Yeah, I could do that.\", \"I\\'m gonna work.\", \"I\\'m honestly not that much.\", \"Now.\", \"He obviously he doesn\\'t.\", \"He doesn\\'t really like to leave his house much.\", \"He\\'s he\\'s kind of going on always there.\", \"So that\\'s kind of he just deals out of there and then shoots up there.\", \"So he, he stays in his house most of the time and he doesn\\'t even come out.Right, right.\", \"right.\", \"I\\'m bored.yeah, just straight up.\", \"I mean, when when there\\'s nothing to do in the house, my parents are gone.\", \"So it\\'s a it\\'s the best way to have fun.right.Right, right.\", \"right.Um, I think like if I if I remember to think what I don\\'t want to do when I think that I\\'m bored, like I just kind of come up something else.\", \"So I right now my usually my two choices when I\\'m bored are either to go to my buddy\\'s house, or go to my gril\\'s houses, you know, across from my buddy.\", \"So maybe that could just be like, one of the times I called my girl and be like, Hey, can you just like come over?\", \"We can do something like just kind of distract me from from, like, wanting to go over dance place, you know?right yeah.Yeah, yeah, I mean, she wasn\\'t too happy with me doing it she doesn\\'t use so I mean there\\'s there\\'s that social All, she\\'ll be on board for that.rightrightRightYeah, I do.\", \"I mean I like as of right now, work scones good, like school is going good.\", \"I don\\'t, I really don\\'t want any problems.\", \"And I think like now If i don\\'t realize that if I if I do keep using, it\\'s not just going to be something like that I do when I\\'m bored or like that I\\'m doing for fun it\\'s going to turn into like a problem that\\'s going to kind of affects everything else.\", \"So I think like, if I just remember to tell myself, like when I\\'m feeling bored if I just remember to tell myself like I don\\'t, I don\\'t want to be out in the streets and like especially I don\\'t want to lose my job.\", \"Like I think telling myself those things that will help remind me like kind of what\\'s at stake.\", \"You knowYeah, I mean, they\\'re my dad works a lot.\", \"My mom\\'s usually she works to a single part time job.\", \"So she\\'s usually like home at night.well it\\'s actually it\\'s more during the day, it\\'s more kind of day.Right.Yeah.Well, I think like one of the one of the other things I do to kind of clear my head as I like to go for a drive.\", \"So like if I if I start feeling bored I think maybe if I like get in my car And like I said, all of that that\\'s his stuff.\", \"I just drive away, like, just physically leave the temptation.\", \"And then like from there, I can go to a bookstore or like a comic book store like I can, I could spend hours in there.\", \"So maybe if I can, like I can remind myself to drive away, go to the stores, and like, maybe I can just kind of stay out there like enough till either like my girlfriend\\'s home or my parents come home.right.Right, right.\", \"right?Rightright?right.okayRight.\", \"YeahOkay.Yeah, definitely.\", \"I think that will definitely help.\", \"Especially especially being in here and after detox.\", \"That would definitely, definitely be the bestYeah.\", \"Thank you.\", \"Thank you.OkayWell, last time I started to tell you a little bit about one of my friends, my best friend Actually, she had this issue.\", \"So what happened was she went to a bathroom at our local library, and she found a video camera when she was going to the bathroomYeah, she actually, yeah.\", \"And she turned it into the police.\", \"And I guess because like she carried it, or she had found it.\", \"Her hand prints were on it and they weren\\'t able to they weren\\'t able to detect who actually did it.\", \"They weren\\'t able to catch the No.\", \"So send Then I\\'ve been on really just high alert, like, I\\'m worried that that could happen to me to my kids.\", \"And I\\'m just really worried because they didn\\'t catch the guy that him or someone like him could be out there.A lot of anxiety just not knowing maybe, you know, what if someone were to videotape me like that, I\\'ve been very aware, shall I say, of cameras.right, Like, I know you have one in your office and people on their cell phone cameras.Just all the possibilities that I could be recorded.\", \"I\\'ve just been very aware of them which makes me not want to go anywhere.\", \"So I\\'ve been having Arguing with my husband a lot because he wants to go out to restaurants and I don\\'t want to go because there could be cameras in the bathrooms and how I dress also as you can see him kind of dress more conservatively because I remember hearing once about cameras that people use on shoes that could be you, you know use in a creepy way and so I I can\\'t you know it\\'s now almost summertime I can\\'t dress and skirt or be comfortable because I\\'m dressing like that.RightNot really no, I would say it\\'s really starting.\", \"That\\'s why I wanted to come in.\", \"It\\'s really starting to affect my life.He just wants to go places with our kids like go out to eat and and I don\\'t really want to go anywhere that because you know cameras are everywhere nowadays.And I just kind of worried like public bathrooms Could they be there someone being you know, sometimes baby monitors or you know have two phones and people can hack into that.\", \"Laptop cameras.\", \"So even in my own house, I\\'ve just been really nervous.\", \"So I feel like I\\'m not really getting relief from that anxiety.I mean, I\\'ve read I\\'ve um, you know, when I go into bathrooms I I\\'ve been looking for cameras to make sure they weren\\'t there before you know me or my children that needs a bathroom.\", \"I have tried, I read online You can learn how to turn off the cameras on your phone, and that you can close your laptop in that way the camera will face down.\", \"So, and the same thing on a smart TV so it doesn\\'t recognize your face.\", \"I\\'ve I\\'ve tried to turn things off, they don\\'t need to be on as far as people being able to access myown information rightExactly.right.right.that there might be a video camera that I don\\'t see that that\\'s maybe like with my friend that was big enough, but I might not catch it in that someone\\'s going to use that in a vulgar way.Yeah.Usually I\\'ll try and find the camera but it\\'s usually anxiety fear.\", \"My heart rate starts going up, I start getting really anxious and then you know, I try and either rush to use the bathroom if I really have to go or a lot of times if I don\\'t, I\\'ll just leave.\", \"Sometimes I try and use bathroom at home so I don\\'t have to go out.Yeah, right, Exactly.I could say if when I walked in the bathroom?maybe I could say, Umm you know, while there could be a chance that there\\'s a camera in this bathroom, the chance of it happening is not very likely.\", \"And You know, I\\'m gonna take steps to keep myself safe, so that I won\\'t be in a vulnerable position such as looking for the camera.Right.right.okay, I mean, I think I would be really upset.\", \"I think I would feel vulnerable probably for a while and be hesitant.\", \"I mean, I would think ultimately, that would be okay.\", \"My friend is happened a while ago, she\\'s starting to get to get over it and get back to her usual routine, although she\\'s still hesitant, so I think I would be okay.\", \"Eventually, although I\\'d be really upset that it happened.That\\'s right.RightProbably it happened like two months, two months?Every day, Yeah.And that\\'s true.\", \"I never thought about it that way.right, Because right now I\\'m suffering every day.I can get itMaybe, you know, like I said, I\\'m worried about all the cameras, maybe I could say, you know, I understand there\\'s some cameras that, you know, use for good purposes, security, right.\", \"And the chances of being recorded illegally are not likely if, and I\\'m taking precautions to you know, go to the right places.\", \"The good areas, good areas.\", \"So it\\'s not likely to happen overall.\", \"And me going outside the house is worth the risk.\", \"You know, the minimal risk that it would happen and if it did happen, I could survive.Right, right.\", \"Okay.Okay.Okay.Yeah.Okay.OkayYeah.\", \"I think that will be helpfulThank you very much.Umm I am kind of doing, I\\'m feeling a little bit stressed outYeah, I feel like I have a lot on my plate.\", \"I have this test that I have to take for work.It\\'s like an aptitude test.\", \"It has like math problems on it and like scenarios in order for me to move up to the system manager position.Yes.\", \"Yes.\", \"So I\\'ve been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually scheduled for me to take the test.\", \"And I want and I just got really overwhelmed.\", \"And I started like I felt my heart was racing.\", \"I felt like I wish my hands were shaking.\", \"And I just really couldn\\'t concentrate on the test.\", \"Even though the night before me and my friend that practice problems, and I knew all the answers with no proper like, I didn\\'t miss any of the questionsyes.No, I wasn\\'t able to complete it.\", \"And thankfully, they gave me a chance to come back.\", \"I just told him I didn\\'t feel well.\", \"So they rescheduled so now I\\'m feeling a lot of anxiety because I\\'m scared the same thing is gonna happe, when I go back.Today, the night before, I felt like I know all the answers, but the minute I walked into the room, all of a sudden, all these fears kind of took over.\", \"Yes, Yes.Yes, I had some anxiety the day before.\", \"But when I reviewed it with my friend, I\\'m like, Oh, I know the answers.\", \"I thought that would kind of push it down.\", \"But I think once I got there, it all came back up to the surface,Well, I\\'ve always kind of struggled with tests.\", \"I\\'m like, I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test, because I was really struggling in math.\", \"And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade.\", \"And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it, I had a tutor, and I felt really prepared for it.\", \"And then when I took it, I failed.\", \"And I was held back.\", \"And I feel like, you know, that was so it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back.\", \"And I felt like I don\\'t want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time.\", \"Because I felt like I really didn\\'t know this.\", \"I don\\'t know why I couldn\\'t pass the test.Yeah.Yes, I always feel really anxious.\", \"I mean, I\\'m able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from college.\", \"School went on to high school.\", \"But it\\'s so hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I know it, I may still fail the test anyway, maybe like a repeat of what happened.noYeah, I mean, sometimes I get an A.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I mean, yeah, it is good.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s good.Yes.I think it\\'s just the fact that it\\'s this promotion.\", \"So it\\'s like the same thing.\", \"Like, if I fail, I\\'m being held back.\", \"And I feel like it\\'s, we live in that moment of being held back.\", \"And that, that that\\'s like a fear that I have that, um, that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back.Yeah, I mean, I didn\\'t put them together until now.\", \"But yeah.Now because they didn\\'t have all that pressure that it was either win win or lose, basically, or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn\\'t do good on that.Yes.\", \"Was it fail, you know, pass or fail?Yeah, if I fail it, then I\\'m not going to be able to get the promotion, I would have to wait.\", \"Just like I did not have to wait a certain amount of time.\", \"I think an ear before I could take it again.Yeah it isUm, no, there isn\\'t.NoYes, it is.\", \"Yeah.Yes.that  I could fail that if I fail I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the things that I tryI would say like I\\'m destined to be.I mean, that\\'s what scares me.\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s exactly the thought that I\\'m thinking when I\\'m about to take the test.\", \"And if I don\\'t pass that, it\\'s just gonna have like this domino effect of failure.Yeah.Yeah, my hands shaking.\", \"Yes, Yeah.No, not really.\", \"I mean, sometimes I get worked out when I\\'m about to take a test, okay, but it\\'s only around test.want to actually do take the test?Um, I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question.Yeah, that\\'s true.\", \"and I could also choose like maybe questions that are no the answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stressyes and then I feel like I know, at least I know that like, Don\\'t validate the feeling that I maybe I can pass this test.Yeah, definitely.\", \"Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that I know these questions are definitely going to be right.Yeah, that\\'s true.\", \"Nobody\\'s there.\", \"Nobody\\'s gonna see me.\", \"I\\'m kind of trying to get myself together.\", \"Probabiy, I could use like self talk.\", \"Yeah,Yeah, I mean, I\\'ve done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test.\", \"yes, that has worked and I passed.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s true.So even if I have to take the test again and in a year, then I\\'m not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again.\", \"It\\'s not like I\\'ll never be able to take this test again.No, no, definitely not.\", \"And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back.\", \"I still managed to, you know, do well the next year and keep moving up.\", \"And it hasn\\'t really, in the long run prevented me from doing anything that I\\'ve wanted to do.Yes, I definitely have.Yeah.\", \"I mean, definitely I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I\\'ve been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to like that feeling that I\\'m going to just fail together.on next week.Okay, right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah, I mean, that sounds good.\", \"That helped me prepare for the test.\", \"yes.Sometimes I cut myself.No, no, No.Want to stick a knife right here and this slit my wristsAll right.all the time, all the time.\", \"Yes.Yes, I do, putting my face on your pillow.I triedd, but I got scared.\", \"I wrote for my family and friends.Yes.AlrightI am 20.At homeMy mom, my dad, my sister.I go to cop.I didn\\'t come to you, my mom and dad and my sister drove me here.\", \"I didn\\'t

better about it.\", \"Yeah, I you know, I know.\", \"We\\'ve talked Before I think that I\\'m gonna that I am gonna commit suicide.Yeah, I have some pills in my house in the medicine cabinet, and

to put me in the hospital.\", \"But now I just want to get it over with and so I really don\\'t want you to do that.I guess, I guess there\\'s, there\\'ll always be a part of me that\\'s a human, you

feel better eventually.\", \"Yeah,And I think that they\\'ll understand that I needed this.Yeah.YeahYeahI\\'m gonna write them a note and tell them everything and tell them it\\'s not their fault

know why you can\\'t let me feel better.yeah, It\\'s possible.Ok Lets gookay.I\\'m doing okayWell, I know we\\'ve talked before about me thinking about suicide and I\\'m starting to think about it,

starting to like I\\'m thinking about it more often.\", \"I\\'m thinking about a little more clearly and that\\'s alarming to me.\", \"Yeah, I will.\", \"Yeah, sometimesUm, I mean, you know, sometimes I know, It would be scary to try it and my husband would be so hurt, but at the same time, I want to end this.\", \"I want to end the feeling that I\\'m having depression.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I mean, I know if I wanted to that we have pills in the cabinet.\", \"So it wouldn\\'t be that hard, I could just take the bottle and Yeah.No, I mean, part of it.\", \"That\\'s why I\\'m nervous because like, I\\'m worried that I might, but at the same time, You know, I\\'m afraid to so sometimes I think that I might and sometimes I think I won\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t want to but sometimes I get scared that I will.In the past, I thought, this will get better.\", \"I just have to keep trying, I thought what will my husband feel when I\\'m gone and my family, my parents, my brother and sister I thought that this is as bad as it can get.\", \"It has to get better eventually.\", \"But now I\\'m just starting to feel like I don\\'t think it\\'s gonna get better.I mean, I feel I feel a little better.\",

know, it\\'s starting to feel like a permanent problem.I wouldn\\'t say markedly but I would say they\\'re different.\", \"They\\'re a little they\\'re stronger,yeahI mean, I guess that has something to do with it, I guess.\", \"It\\'s just like when I look to everything, like everything that could be good or everything, just everything like life, my relationships, the future I just look at it and I see despair.\", \"I just see everything going wrong.\", \"And I just don\\'t see how it could get better.\", \"I just don\\'t see itYes.Probably a week, maybe a little lessI\\'m afraid to do it.\",

\"Well, I mean, so I have to take them.\", \"It\\'s my prescription.\", \"So when it\\'s time I start thinking about it.\", \"Like it\\'s more I think about my like, the ideations come even more because it\\'s like a trigger like I\\'m thinking about the pills.\", \"So I go to the cabinet, and I get my pills and I and I take the, the one that I\\'m supposed to, but I just look at the bottle and I kind of stand there and I just think Instead of putting the bottle back, I could take it with me.It takes a while but I put it back.\", \"It\\'s It\\'s scary.\", \"Like I look into the bottle and I\\'m afraid because dying is scary, but Yeah, I don\\'t want to do that.\", \"I don\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t want my husband to find me, I don\\'t want him to feel like this is his fault.\", \"I don\\'t want him to be sad that I\\'m gone.\", \"I don\\'t want him to feel like I feel.Yeah.\", \"It\\'s not it\\'s not their fault.\", \"And I know that they wouldn\\'t be able to get over it and I know that they\\'ll be thinking about how bad I felt they\\'ll have to know what it really felt like for me.I don\\'t want toNo, I think I think if I can just remember what it\\'ll be like for them.\", \"That\\'ll keep me from doing it.\", \"You know, it\\'s the times that I forget to think about how they\\'re going to feel that I get closer to the edge.\", \"But when I remember, you know, like, It upsets me to think about what it\\'ll be like for them.\", \"So if I can remember to think about that and it\\'ll help me not do that.\", \"But I think having the pills there in the cabinet like that is a big temptation for me.Yeah.Okay.Yeah, I think I think that would be a good idea.I think, I think yeah, I think it would be a good idea to just make sure that everything that was in the medicine cabinetyeah.Right.\", \"Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that he would be willing to do that.\", \"He doesn\\'t.\", \"He wants me to get through this.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Oh, I\\'ll do

\"I did.\", \"And it was, it was, it was a it would give me some relief, because I was I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking.\", \"And so I Yes, yes, I\\'ve had success with walking before.Yes.really haven\\'t been doing too much of anything I\\'ve just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over doing getting homework done.\", \"Because I\\'m, you know, back in

so much work to be done and sometimes a good you know, several assignments.\", \"Do And at the same time, and I find myself rushing to get assignments and and, you know, it can just be a little daunting.\", \"It\\'s just overwhelming sometimes.\", \"So yeah.\", \"And I don\\'t know, maybe if I spaced that out and, you know, took, you know, did some time management or something like that I don\\'t know, to kind of help meYeah, yeah.Yes, I would say that.I\\'m sure it would you sure would.Okay, that sounds doableYes.Let\\'s see.You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing.\", \"And right now I feel like I\\'m not doing any of the things that I\\'ve enjoyed doing because I\\'ve been so busy doing work doing homework, so I think that would probably help.Yes.Yes, it is.\", \"It is.\", \"Enjoy access to enjoy singing, and, you know, I enjoy the people that I was saying with and we will go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs or events, you know, different bands that were playing it you know, it\\'ll just be nice.\", \"It\\'s fun.\", \"I love music.\", \"So I love listening to it and I love you know, singing.\", \"So making music.\", \"So that

haven\\'t gone to visit her in a while.\", \"And the thing is, she only lives like an hour away.\", \"So it\\'s not a it\\'s not right.\", \"No, it\\'s not.\", \"So that\\'s like a, you know, a trip I couldn\\'t do on a Saturday.\", \"Take a break and go down there and spend some time with that will be I think that will be helpful.right.Um, maybe I can start out with twice a week, twice quickly.Maybe we need to start with one day a week.Okay, About Monday?It is.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Plus, it just kind of, I think, no, no.\", \"How about Wednesday?\", \"Yes.\", \"Wednesday, middle of the week.\", \"Stress from work and school and yes, Wednesday.\", \"Sounds good.like 6:30.yes, off work.\", \"And give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door.\", \"Because if I, if I make it too late, I\\'m not going to goit depends on the assignment.the average two hoursMaybe it depends, becauseyeah, the secondMaybe a couple of weeks.I get distracted.\", \"So a little distracted.\", \"So it\\'s, you know, I start reading and I\\'ll fall asleep or I get distracted by something.\", \"And then before you know it, the time is gone.\", \"And I\\'m rushing at the end to get it shown up to try and get it all done.On Tuesdays on Tuesdays.shipping.\", \"Okay?I\\'m come back from my walk on Wednesdays.Well, normally only half an hour.I\\'ll get started.Yeah, that\\'s due Thursday.Thursday\\'sSunday, SundayI can try.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah,Sunday around fiveYes.But it would be a relief.It does.every fridayYeah.\", \"But one Friday is generally it\\'s maybeYeah, I mean, if I if it was something that came up that I really had to get done is not like I can\\'t not go.\", \"So it won\\'t be managed, right?That would be more like a Saturday.\", \"But of course, it wouldn\\'t be every Saturday.Yes.Yeah, if I, if all those Saturdays that I know that I\\'m going I could not be out too late on that.or not go at all, that\\'s fine.\", \"Either way,um, I would like to try thatThank you.I am alrightI mean obviously I\\'m not doing great I you know asked you to have this session we didn\\'t we weren\\'t scheduled for today.\", \"I just I don\\'t know I just I\\'m feeling you know, depressed as usual but it\\'s just it\\'s stronger and I\\'m just feeling I just don\\'t want to wake up I justYeahNot really.\", \"I mean, it\\'s just the same except one You know, like, I just I feel like what\\'s the point?\", \"I don\\'t feel like continuing on.Yeah, kind ofI mean, I think about what it would be like to just end things.\", \"I think it would be a lot easier.\", \"But at the same time, like, I can\\'t imagine doing it.\", \"But you know, I can\\'t say I haven\\'t thought about it.\", \"I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I guess I know what it would be like for my family.\", \"I don\\'t want to hurt them.Yes and it\\'s scary, I mean, the thought of dying is scary, but the thought of going on is painful.Yeah, I kind of feel like I\\'m stuck between a rock and a hard place.\", \"Like I just don\\'t know where to go from here.No, I mean, you know, you know, I thought like if I were to do it, you know, ways but not not specific because I just don\\'t think that I could do it, you know, like, I don\\'t.\", \"I thought about suicide, but I don\\'t like, seriously consider it as an option.\", \"But it\\'s starting to like creep into my thoughts.\", \"And it never has before so that I\\'m like, kind of concerned about that.\", \"Like, I guess I know.\", \"Sometimes people like really planted and but for me, I\\'ve it\\'s an I\\'ve never really considered it before so it\\'s really scaryfor me.\", \"Um, I think like in the past couple of days, it started you know, more so and then like today, it was just like the first thought in my head and I couldn\\'t stop thinking about it and that\\'s why I wanted to see you because I\\'m just feeling I\\'m starting to feel like a little bit out of control.Yeah, I don\\'t want to I, I really don\\'t want to but, you know, like I said, I feel like I\\'m stuck between a rock and a hard place like it.\", \"It\\'s not, I know it\\'s not a good option.\", \"I just like Sometimes I feel like I\\'m so stuck.\", \"I just don\\'t know where else to go.Definitely, I think that is like the reason why I, the reason why the thought of not living anymore comes into my head is because of my depression because I just feel so like, my emotions are out of control, because I wake up feeling so down and so useless and pointless, that it makes me wish that I was dead.\", \"But if I didn\\'t have that feeling, then I wouldn\\'t wish that I was dead.\", \"Because I know that my life has value and I know that my family would want me around and I know there\\'s a future for me, but my feelings make me feel like my future is just dark and pointlessWell, I didn\\'t I didn\\'t really have plans because I kind of you know, came here feeling like I really needed to see you so I kind of put things on hold but I mean, I guess I would go home and, and, you know, I\\'m not really sure.\", \"No.\", \"But, I mean, I probably could go to my parents house if I needed to, I could probably call them in and see, you know, it\\'s getting close to the afternoon so they get off work soon.Yeah, I think that\\'s a good idea.I think you mentioned it before.\", \"I\\'m not really sure.Yeahyeah.Thank you.I am

been really sort of preoccupied and anxious a lot this week.\", \"My daughter got sick.\", \"So I had to take three days off of work to take care of her and I\\'m starting to worry, she\\'s been sick a lot since I\\'ve gone back to work she\\'s in daycare.\", \"And I\\'ve had to take a lot of time off work and I\\'m getting close to going over my allotted amount of days.\", \"And so I\\'m finding myself being very anxious about that and then feeling guilty because when I\\'m trying to take care of her, I\\'m always worrying about work so, Yeah.The last time I had to take off work?It was just this week.\", \"She woke up one morning with a really high fever.\", \"So I had to call out that day and then she still had a favourites The next day, and then I had to take a third day because she has to be fever free before she can go back to daycare.\", \"So the first day was, I was okay with that.\", \"But then like the second and then when I started realizing that I was going to have to take a third day, and I really start to get kind of panicky and were worried about it.well, because she\\'s been sort of sick a lot lately, I was a little bit worried.\", \"And I was sort of, you know, I have this number 10 because I only have 10 days for the whole year.\", \"So I had this number in my head and I just thought, Okay, well, there\\'s one more day I got to take away from that 10 that I have, and but I was able to sort of think about, I was a little worried about any work that I would miss, you know, keeping up with my caseload and stuff at work, so, but I was able to kind of figure out that I would be okay for a day and I can kind of make up for that when I get get back.Yesrightand I got a little bit more worried and then I did start to also, you know, add the worry of I was going to start to get behind at work.\", \"Not only was I missing more time, but I was also going to be behind on my work.\", \"So then I started thinking, when I go back, it\\'s going to be a mad scramble and kind of catch up and keep up with everything.\", \"And you know, so it was going to became worrying about my workload and worrying about taking more time.\", \"I was then it was just more amplified, you know, amplified worry, and it was a lot harder for me to let it go.\", \"I just kept thinking I kept going back to it.\", \"And then I started feeling guilty.\", \"Because I was so preoccupied worried about that.\", \"And I was trying to answer emails and do some stuff and send out some emails to people that I work with to try to help me out with things at work since I wasn\\'t there.\", \"And then I felt guilty because I wasn\\'t really caring for my child as best as I felt I should have been, you know, I started feeling kinda like a bad mom.Yes.Well, I checked in with the main office and you know, I just said I\\'m really you know, I\\'m starting to worry I\\'m getting I know I\\'m had to take a lot of time.\", \"But you know, I\\'ve done the best I can to try to make other arrangements but my, you know, just starting back in, starting in daycare, she\\'s just been sick a lot, and I can\\'t control it.\", \"I\\'m doing the best I can.\", \"You know, I asked them if there was anything I needed to do as far as providing doctor\\'s notes and stuff.\", \"And they said no, that they you know, they don\\'t need a doctor\\'s note since it was my daughter that was sick.\", \"They said there\\'s nothing nothing that I really couldn\\'t do and just try to not have it happen much more if I canYeah, but yeah.\", \"They kind of just said, you know, do what you can do not have it happen, but if it you know if it has to happen, you know, what can I do about it?\", \"It was kind of they were sayingI didn\\'t feel like they were that understanding, but I also didn\\'t feel like they were gonna take any punitive action against me, right, right then and there or anything.Yeah, I did.\", \"And I also anticipated that they would maybe have more of a procedure for how to handle it and they didn\\'t have a procedure which also made me feel a little worried.\", \"I can\\'t imagine I\\'m the first mom that has had to deal with this.\", \"And they kind of talked like It\\'s never happened before.\", \"So I kind of felt anxious, because I thought, am I really the first mom that\\'s had to take a lot of time off because their child sick.\", \"They didn\\'t give me the impression that they had sort of a protocol or like they had dealt with this before.Yeah, or they just didn\\'t have a plan for what to do about it.No, no, I guess not.Just this past week, this week.Oh, it\\'s been very busy because I\\'m trying to catch up and get everything handled.\", \"But that\\'s the way it always, always is.\", \"So nobody has said anything to me or anything about the absences Yeah.NopeUmm somebody who takes care of their child and puts them makes them a priority, like their first priority.\", \"And, you know, does the things that they need to do to make sure their child is taken care of.Yeah, I felt like I wasn\\'t being a good mom because I was preoccupied and making work a bit of a bigger priority than taking care of my kid.Yeah.Yeah.Um, well, somebody that, you know, takes care of all of their workload and handles all of the tasks that they have each day and someone that\\'s consistent and reliable, and, you know, puts effort into what they\\'re doing and gets their job done.\", \"Really, you know, reliably.Well, I missed a lot for maternity leave.I\\'ve missed out since the school year started, I\\'ve missed if you include the three.\", \"I\\'ve missed nine days.\", \"But some of those were half days.\", \"They add up to nine days.\", \"Yeah.10 per school year, it\\'s only January and I\\'m already at nine.I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I think that they would dock my pay for the for those for it.\", \"If I was there a day and I didn\\'t have any more sick days left.\", \"They would just dock my pay for that day.\", \"But outside of that, I don\\'t know what else would happen.Yeah, I guess I could contact the HR department.Yeah, a little bitA little bit sometimes when I start feeling like I\\'m a bad mom.probably sort of the guilt and the feelings of not being able to be the best mom.I\\'m probably like an eight.Yeah.I guess like halfway like, Yeah, feel like It\\'s not good enough for me.\", \"I wouldn\\'t be okay with that.Probably.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, that\\'s not YeahI don\\'t know.\", \"At least a seven.YeahNoYes, not as good a mother as I want to beYeah, I want to be like a eight or higher,YeahWell, yeah, doesn\\'t everybody want to be the best at what they do?No, there\\'s some leeway, I guess you have to allow for that.In some ways, it\\'s useful because it keeps me keeps me on track if that makes sense.\", \"It keeps me pushing to keep doing the best I can.Well, yeah, I guess it does in the sense that if I become too worried about it, then I\\'m wasting energy on worry instead of being able to put that energy into being good mom.Probably not.YeahYeah.Exactly.Yeah, I can see that.Yeah.\", \"Um, no, it was really the night But, um, well, you know, I went as far as to think, am I gonna get fired?\", \"You know, I had to kind of think aboutYeah.panic and worry Oh, yeah, some anxiety?\", \"Yeah.Oh, I did tell myself that I didn\\'t go over yet.\", \"And, you know, hopefully I won\\'t, you know, there\\'s still a chance that I\\'m not going to go over on my days and hopefully won\\'t go so far as to fire me, you know,a little bit better, but the still kept hovering around.\", \"YeahYeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Like I wanted to call somebody at work and talk to them about it and make sure it was okay.\", \"But you know, it was the weekend, so I couldn\\'t do any of those things.\", \"I just had to wait it out.\", \"Yeah.Right.Yes.\", \"not useful in that momentyeahWell, I guess I could say, you know, I didn\\'t, you know, I\\'m not.\", \"I haven\\'t had any conversations with anybody that have indicated that.\", \"So sort of like maybe I just need to not worry about it or cross that bridge when I come to it kind of thing.\", \"Like, hopefully it won\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t know if it will happen or not.\", \"And hopefully it won\\'t happen.rightYeah, my mom can.\", \"can sometimes I did call her this this week to see if she could take one of take a day.\", \"But she couldn\\'t because of what she had going On, but in in other times she might be able to take a day and stay home or my sister can do that as well.\", \"And my husband can sometimes it depends on what is going on that week for him at work.\", \"So there are some options there.I did.\", \"I did, but just the circumstances didn\\'t work out.\", \"right.That\\'s really it.\", \"You know, when she\\'s sick, and that\\'s really it, because you don\\'t i don\\'t want to put her around any other kids, which is why I wouldn\\'t send her to daycare.\", \"SoRight.Yeah.Yes,Yeah, Except for my my thinking I was maybe a little not as present as I should have been.Yeah.I guess it\\'s not ideal, but it\\'s okay.you know, or at least be able to put my worry about the other circumstances aside for the time for that time period.RightYeahYeah.that I\\'m doing them behaving doing the behaviors that I need to do and the baby doesn\\'t know what I\\'m thinking so probably not.\", \"She doesn\\'t know what I\\'m distracted or worried.\", \"So I\\'m not doing any harm to her.I guess just me.Yeah.right.true.rightYeah.\", \"It makes sense.\", \"And, you know, when you say it back to me the things that I\\'m saying it does sound a little bit irrational, or unhelpful less than useful.\", \"RightTRUEOkay okay.Yes.\", \"Yes.yeah, I think I can handle that.\", \"Yeah.Okay, thank you.\", \"I am All right, I\\'m a little bit stressed out right now.\", \"Well, as you know, I\\'m in a graduate program right now.\", \"And I\\'m just really coming to the near the end of my program and I\\'m just finding it increasingly difficult.\", \"I\\'m just really stressed with how things have been going.\", \"Well, I don\\'t I don\\'t, I don\\'t really know.\", \"It\\'s just I am, as I\\'ve told you, before, I take school really seriously and I really strive to do well, well in school and well on my assignments and I just feel like I\\'m not performing, as well as I needed toWell, I\\'ve been getting A\\'s,NoYeah.\", \"I just feel like it\\'s getting harder to get the Asright, It used to be so easy for me to do what my teachers expect and to get good grades.\", \"Now I feel like it\\'s, it\\'s really a struggle and I\\'m not doing as well as I need to and I\\'m constantly worried about not doing this well.My teachers all seem to think I\\'m doing well.\", \"They actually I see To get good feedback on my assignments, but I feel like I feel like I just to make sure I\\'m doing well.\", \"I really focus on like the details like making sure that the instructions are really clear, like I\\'m doing everything, like perfectly as an Instructure instructor wants because I\\'m really afraid that you know, if I\\'m not really clear on what the assignment is, then maybe I won\\'t do it the right way.\", \"right like I find myself like emailing the teacher like almost like obsessively, like trying to, to clarify the assignment and to make sure do they think I\\'m doing well in class and and what not.Well, I guess I\\'m just feeling that, you know, I\\'ve worked really hard, this whole program and I don\\'t want to mess it up now or, you know, because if I don\\'t get these grades, and I feel like what was the use, if I met, then I\\'m going to be ruining all this hard work, that I\\'ve done this whole program if I kind of, if I don\\'t maintain that level of, you know, like you said, precision, I feel like like that I\\'ve let myself down or that I\\'m a failure because I\\'m, I just slacked off at the end of the program and it\\'s so close to being done.probably less than an A.\", \"Anything other than AI mean, I guess I would be okay with that, but I wouldn\\'t be really happy with it.\", \"I wouldn\\'t be that excited about that.I wouldn\\'t be happy with that.yeah.to me like, like an A minus I would maybe be okay with but like, below that like to me like a B, whether it\\'s like a B minus A B, A, B plus it\\'s all B, and that\\'s not anthat I didn\\'t try hard enough, but there\\'s something else I could have done to to do better that I was like, slacking or I didn\\'t read the directions right or I didn\\'t have enough responses or make my paper long enough.\", \"I just didn\\'t do enough.\", \"If I didn\\'t try hard enough that I was lazy.Yeah, that I could have tried harder and I didn\\'t.\", \"So why didn\\'t I try?\", \"I didn\\'t, maybe I didn\\'t care.\", \"I was lazy.\", \"Kind of like what\\'s the use?\", \"If you\\'re not gonna try your best and why try it all?Yes.YeahI\\'m not quite sure.\", \"Like it didn\\'t stress me out as much in the beginning of the program.\", \"Like I really like school.\", \"But now I feel like I\\'m static because it\\'s anxiety producing for me because, you know, I\\'m constantly worriedWell, the only thing I can think of is we have the same students throughout our program.\", \"But I guess this semester there\\'s a new student in the program and I know that you mentioned and it seems like she\\'s kind of really stressing me out.\", \"And also well see throughout the program, I kind of considered myself like to be the student who got the best grades and there\\'s this award at the end of the program for doing really well.\", \"And I kind of made it a goal of mine to get this award at the end because I felt like that would show that I really tried hard this program really meant a lot to me.\", \"I think You know, it would show people who viewed Did that, you know, I really busted my butt and, and did a good job in this program.\", \"And for the whole program so far, you know, that was me like that was I was kind of the front runner, I guess for this award.\", \"And this semester, there\\'s a new student and then come to find out like she had a 4.0 in her other program.\", \"So,right like I feel like the pressures on like, I felt like I tried so hard, this whole program and now like this new person comes in, and she might want a different me so I really need to go above and beyond to make sure that I\\'m still on track.right.\", \"And it\\'s causing me a lot of anxiety with school where it\\'s not as enjoyable for me as it once was.I guess part of me feels like them.\", \"Why did I do the program?\", \"if, you know, part of me feels like if you\\'re not going to be the best why try?\", \"So if, if she got the award over me, then it\\'s kind of like, why did I work so hard this whole time, like I could have been slacking this whole time and just skated by so why did I bust my butt?\", \"If it was all for nothing?\", \"I don\\'t have anything to show for it.\", \"I mean, I guess it\\'s not the only thing that matters so part of me feels that way sometimes that I have these thoughts that if I don\\'t try my hardest and do well and win this award, then why do I try so hard the rest of the time, but like it negates all the positive things.\", \"This that this, you know, kind of like the end result like if you tried hard the whole race and then you lose, you know, at the end.Yeah.right and even know about the award until probably like the second year anyway, so that wasn\\'t the reason I entered.\", \"But,Yeah.Right.Yeah.Rightright now I\\'m not even I feel like when I read, like, I\\'m so stressed with it from reading the right thing and memorizing every word that I\\'m not retaining all the information, so it could and it\\'s starting to like impact school.I mean, it kind of sounds silly when you when you\\'re reflecting it back to me how, you know that I have to read the words like I, I think that it makes sense.\", \"You know, that wasn\\'t my goal going into it.\", \"You know, why does it matter so much to me that there\\'s different degrees of success.\", \"I think if you\\'ve said before that is Not all about the award, I think I would be happy with just, you know, getting the degree and all the stuff that I\\'ve learned.\", \"And I would feel like it was, if I didn\\'t get the award rather, I would feel like it was still a worthwhile journey.\", \"But in the moment, sometimes it\\'s really upsetting at the thought of not getting the award.\", \"But that\\'s a possibility.\", \"Right, exactly.\", \"yepI don\\'t think so I am thinking about I don\\'t think of a long term many people would know about it besides me, or if I put it, you know, on a resume or something, but I don\\'t think it would make that much of a difference.right at the beginning, I didn\\'t even know about it.Right, Right.right, It makes me it makes me paranoid to make mistakes or to try and take risks or to really, you know, do well because I\\'m so worried about judgment, like from my teachers, if I\\'m doing well enough.\", \"Right.\", \"Right.Right, like I\\'m walking on eggshells, and I\\'m just expecting my grades to tank if I if I kind of like deviate from that line.It\\'s really hard.if I\\'m you If I want when I\\'m just doing the work,I guess I\\'m just kind of like running through a checklist.\", \"Did I do this?\", \"Did I do this?\", \"Did I do this?\", \"Making sure I did everything that was expected of meRight.Right.That  I must win the award?I guess I could say that, you know, this, the award is something local to my university and no one\\'s going to know about it in the grand scheme of things.\", \"So it won\\'t really impact future employment or what my colleagues think of me.\", \"You know, if I, if I don\\'t get the award that they won\\'t think less of me.right.I feel like sometimes I do.\", \"And then sometimes it\\'s really hard in the heat of the moment to kind of talk myself down from that, that kind of spiral of not doing this assignment, right?\", \"I\\'m not doing well.\", \"I\\'m going to get to be in this class, I\\'m going to lose this award.\", \"So I feel like it starts.\", \"It\\'s hard in the moment to spiral out of that.Maybe like half the time,right?\", \"depends on what\\'s going on in my stress.RightI don\\'t even know she knows about the award.Yeah.\", \"I think I would tell her that, you know, the rest of the class sees that she\\'s doing well.\", \"Her teachers give her positive feedback.\", \"So all science would point towards that you\\'re doing really well and you\\'re being very successful in the program that you\\'re getting positive feedback from them.\", \"So that all the signs the feedback is telling you you\\'re doing a really good job.definitely it is.I don\\'t know sometimes I feel like I just hold myself to a higher standard than I hold other people to like if some a friend of mine like Joyce would come and tell me the same situation, you know, I\\'d be able to give her a whole bunch of, you know, suggestions or some positive feedback, but it\\'s really hard for me sometimes because I hold myself to a higher standard than other people.Yes.Correct.\", \"Makes sense in my head and I would know what to tell someone else but I don\\'t always believe it.\", \"When I say to myself,Okayright.OkayOkayHmmThanks.I\\'m doing okay.I did traffic wasn\\'t too bad.yeah, I\\'m just been a lot of anxiety right now my oldest child is moving out.\", \"And I know as a mom that that\\'s the goal is to, you know, let them be independent and you start on their own but still a little concerned that it\\'s gonna work out and that you know that he\\'s in a good place and living where he should and kind of eat dinner and do those things that you worry about him doing.\", \"Absolutely.\", \"The sooner the better.Okay.Okay.Okay.\", \"So like attorneys what you what you can do and not do.Okay.\", \"Now explain the differences to me.So there\\'s times you might tell someone else something that I said,Okay.Yeah.\", \"I\\'d like to know that before I tell you.I do?\", \"Yes.That makes sense, Okay.That makes a lot of sense.so it goes automatically whatever progress made you have automatically go to the insurance company?Okay.taking all your medical stuff too.\", \"So they have,I don\\'t know why I not hurt anybody, but I should know thisOkayOkaySo you say, so, if someone\\'s thinking about it, you are not just gonna call the police and send you to the hospital.\", \"You\\'re gonna try to get to the bottom of it.Okay.Okay That makes sense.\", \"Okay.Okay.It Does.\", \"Yes.\", \"Okay.Okay.seems pretty clear.Okay.Yes, I\\'d like that.Yes.\", \"It\\'ll be fine.Umm a few weeks ago, I was due to meet up with some friends from antenatal classes.\", \"We used to meet up every week.\", \"But I felt so tired and low.\", \"Just couldn\\'t gowhen I started thinking about the other mothers laughing and chatting, and I wouldn\\'t have anything to say.\", \"They\\'d probably think that I was boring.\", \"Why would they want me there?\", \"If I was just going to make everyone else miserable?really lowWill the other children always seem so happy, I started thinking maybe the other mother is doing a better job than me.\", \"And I worry a lot about Molly and wondered if she\\'d be better off for one or the other mums.That made me feel really sadWe seem so in control with my depression.\", \"I just feel guilty that I\\'m not very good mother.I

drink, he\\'s very, very difficult to talk to.Yes, I do.\", \"I think that the drinking has definitely changed his behavior significantly.\", \"And he\\'s very unreasonable and he\\'s has a very short fuse.\", \"He\\'s very, very easy to to make angry over the smallest of things.\", \"Well, he does have a very good relationship with the children and he actively participates in their in their daily lives and the children haven\\'t mentioned anything to me and they don\\'t seem to have changed their behavior in any way, the arguments don\\'t tend to happen in front of the children either.\",

issues, and it just seems to escalate out of control.\", \"that that\\'s true, that\\'s right.\", \"I think the drinking is my my main issue with with his behavior.\", \"And I think the drinking is greatly contributing to the way that he\\'s behaving towards me.I have.\", \"I\\'ve tried to talk to him about the drinking a couple of times, and he just gets very, very defensive with me.That\\'s true.\", \"That\\'s correct.\", \"Yes.Well, I\\'m hopeful that we could resolve the issues that we\\'re having and although at the moment, I feel like I need a break away from him.\", \"If he was able

the night, and I\\'ll think thatI locked the door.\", \"Is the door locked?\", \"And I can\\'t fall back asleep.Sometimes it takes maybe an hour two.I\\'m just worried that I left the door unlocked.\", \"And sometimes I\\'ll hear sounds.\", \"And I think maybe someone\\'s in the apartment or I just, I get nervous.\", \"I just get scared.Now I sit in bed, and I just try to I just think about it.It gets, it gets worse.I mean, I try to fall back asleep, and I stay in bed and I just think, you know, maybe I did leave the door unlocked.\", \"And then I just keep thinking that maybe it isn\\'t locked.Yeah.Um, well, I have like a ceiling fan above me.\", \"So sometimes, I\\'ll just like, count how many times it goes around and just to distract myself from thinking about it.\", \"But I still think about the door being unlocked.\", \"Sometimes it helps.Um, sometimes if I\\'m leaving for work, I\\'ll get to my car and I\\'ll think I let the hair Sugarland.\", \"And I\\'ll think to myself, should I go back?\", \"I don\\'t know what to do.\", \"And I\\'ll just, like, kind of debate whether or not I should just go double check.\", \"I\\'m just worried that if I left the straightener on something, you know, that would happen, Well, I mean, if I left the strainer on something, you know, it\\'s if I have like clothes or something and it\\'s it\\'s on a quad like that burn, or if it\\'s I just don\\'t want anything.\", \"I don\\'t want to place the burn down was nervous about.Yeah.Normally I think about it before I get to my car, and I\\'m like, well, maybe I should just go just to make sure I unplugged it and I turned it off.\", \"And then sometimes during the day, I\\'ll be at work and I can\\'t focus just because I\\'m thinking about, I\\'ll come back and I\\'ll see you know, my apartment burned down so I left the strainer plugged in.No, I haven\\'t.\", \"But it just I think about it.\", \"I would if I did leave it.\", \"If I did leave it on or plugged in.Yeah.Yeah, definitely.\", \"All three.Probably throughout the day.every day, yeah.For Ever since I moved, I guess into the apartment.\", \"So about I guess a year yeah.Yeah.Um, it started out with just, you know, I would go to bed and I would wake up in the light and think to myself tonight, the door I\\'m pretty sure I locked the door.\", \"And then I would just be fine.\", \"I could go back to sleep and be like, no, I remember I locked it.\", \"But then as it progressed, I really, I would wake up multiple times throughout the night.\", \"And I wouldit would just keep me up.yeahNoNo, never.NoNookayThank you.what?You\\'re joking on you, aren\\'t you.\", \"I mean, look, I\\'ve made time in my day to come here.\", \"I\\'m kept in your waiting room for 45 minutes.\",

I\\'ve got clients to coming in.\", \"Yeah, I mean, Okay, fair enough.\", \"I\\'ve got to have my blood pressure, medication change, but I really haven\\'t got time to talk about my weight.\", \"I mean, you know, I\\'m aware of my weight.\", \"I\\'m aware of the problems and I\\'m also aware of the solutions.\", \"So I don\\'t really need a discussion.\", \"It\\'s just I\\'ve got too much to do at the moment, you know,It\\'s been it\\'s bad for me, you knowYeah.\", \"But basically, I\\'ve got things to do.\", \"I got back to the office.\", \"I\\'ve got a pile of work that I\\'ve got to deal with.\", \"And every time every moment of my day, it means I have to work in the evening or weekends, it counts.\", \"When you\\'re self employed.\", \"You haven\\'t got a choice.Well, I\\'m here now

weight, but know that it\\'s causing problems.\", \"I mean, obviously, I get out of breath.\", \"If I have to do something about Harry and I realize that I\\'m on this blood pressure.\", \"Right.\", \"And maybe that\\'s probably contributing to it.Yeah.\", \"I mean, there are other things, but I mean, yeah, the weight is a, something I would like to get hold of you get on the handle,Yeah, I mean, I know the theories of bit of exercise on a regular basis, a balanced diet.\", \"But unfortunately, because of my lifestyle, because of being self employed as an accountant, it\\'s finding the time to exercise but also finding the time to sort of think, Okay, I\\'m going to go shopping for this, that and the other.\", \"Yeah, prepare a meal.\", \"Yeah, with me.\", \"It\\'s very often Yeah, yeah.\", \"Food on the run, you know, grazing.Yeah.\", \"I mean, I, to certain extent, because of my lifestyle.\", \"Food is just fuel.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"You know, because I\\'m juggling all these balls, and I don\\'t want to drop any,Okay, I\\'m up for that.\", \"But it\\'s going to be the same problem of A finding time and B if I make an appointment.\", \"I don\\'t expect to be kept waiting for half an hour, whatever.\", \"Because it\\'sall maybe have a look at my schedule, see whether anything can be arranged, or I can pass something on to some and so like, so it\\'s not a wasted interview.\", \"So I can come in and say, okay, I\\'ve looked at my schedules, I\\'ve looked at thingsYeah, course good stuff.\", \"Okay.\", \"Okay, thanks.\", \"Sorry, I went off of a bit.HiYeah, I thought I should.\", \"I\\'ve been feeling quite bad for quite a while.\", \"So I thought maybe it\\'s time to see someone about it because I don\\'t want to feel like this anymore.And quite a few months before that as well, actually, but it\\'s gotten pretty bad these past few months.\", \"So that\\'s kind of why I came.YeahLike kind of started just feeling a bit low and about things but I don\\'t know Just recently I just can\\'t really be bothered to do anything at all I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things and I want to buy I really want to be better but it\\'s just kind of reaching the head now I just want to do something about it.Yeah.Yeah, I just, it\\'s kind of hard as well because there\\'s not really anyone to talk about so I just kind of stay on my own trying to I don\\'t like to think about it.\", \"ButYeah, no one I can talk to about it.\", \"Don\\'t put less than on stand anyway.Yeah.Yeah, I live with friends.Yeah, I mean, they\\'re lovely.\", \"I, I get on really well with them.\", \"But I didn\\'t know I recently whenever they want to go out or stuff, I just, I don\\'t want to bring them down.\", \"I can\\'t, they don\\'t understand what I\\'m going through.\", \"They kind of they don\\'t make fun of how I feel, but they don\\'t really understand what it\\'s like.\", \"I don\\'t want to go out with them and bring them down.I guess I mean, it\\'s easier to hide it than to try to explain it all the time when no one really wants to know.No, I don\\'t really talk to my parents about it.Yeah.\", \"I guess kind of started, When I was actually when I was revising for my exams.\", \"I guess the stress.\", \"I put a lot of stress on myself.\", \"I think I\\'ve always wanted to do well for me, and I guess my parents, so the stress of exams, and it was, was kind of hard because my parents were going through trouble time thatYeah, I think soYes.Yeah, I guess it was hard as well because I wasn\\'t doing well at uni it I guess I just felt a bit guilty.\", \"I know it sounds silly, but I felt like maybe if I could do better than they would get better but it just was really happening.Yeah, I wanted to make them feel better, but it just kind of terrified me likeIt just ended up with them getting worse and I\\'ve just been feeling worse since then.Not very well.Its just annoying because I know, I should have done better.\", \"And I just didn\\'t and I guess I beat myself up a lot.Maybe more than other people.\", \"My parents have always kind of taught me not in a loving way, I guess but But you should do your best, but also get the best and I agree with that.\", \"I think that\\'s the right thing to think.\", \"But when I don\\'t do that, I don\\'t know, annoys me a lot.\", \"I worried that it annoys them.no.I think it doesn\\'t sound good.\", \"I don\\'t really talk to them a lot, but I don\\'t think they\\'re going through very good.\", \"I don\\'t like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse.\", \"But I don\\'t think it\\'s getting any better.A fair  little bit YeahNot very fun.\", \"No, it was quite tense all the time.\", \"stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer.Really not good to be honest.\", \"Actually, If I don\\'t have to do that, I don\\'t really leave the house or get out of bed.\", \"I just I can\\'t find the motivation for the things I used to join.\", \"I used to love doing sports or going out and now I just prefer that lie in bed and not really do anything.\", \"Okay, I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone to.I don\\'t really see the point anymore.\", \"If, if I can\\'t do as well as I should be doing, then what\\'s the point in putting myself in those positions?\", \"I can\\'t be bothered anymore to try it just stresses me out more than I need to.Yeah.Like I said, No, I I don\\'t really even deserve to be here.\", \"If I can\\'t do well enough.\", \"I feel these other students are doing well and doing better and want to be there.\", \"I don\\'t know why I\\'m here even you need to be.Yeah.Very unworthy.\", \"Probably will be the best way to put it kind of I didn\\'t know lower than normal.\", \"It makes me think about all the Things I should have been doing better.Sad not happy with.\", \"I have kind of anger and frustration as well.Yes.\", \"embarrassed.\", \"I\\'ve never yet talked about it, So it\\'s quite uncomfortable to be in this situation.I used to be, I think from those emotions very wound up very kind of stressed all the time.\", \"Recently, it\\'s just a lot more draining than anything, just quite lethargic and can\\'t be bothered anymore.\", \"And it\\'s, my body reflects that.\", \"But then when I try and sleep I just can\\'t seem to have a satisfied by sleep.\", \"It\\'s really, really frustrating.kind of focus on the negative thoughts when I probably should not think about them, but I focus on them and then I don\\'t really want to do anything gonna stay in bed orI guess I felt slightly worse, but then a bit numb in a way, kind of once you\\'ve felt bad because I do feel tired all the time, I just try and push it out.\", \"And then you don\\'t really think about anything.\", \"And it\\'s almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you\\'re getting wrong and how much you can\\'t do stuff.\", \"Sometimes it\\'s better just to not think about it at all.probably in the long run.I am doing alright, I guess.OkaySure.Okay.Sure.OkayOh, okay.\", \"YeahOkay.Umm yeahSo you can tell them my deep dark secrets,good.That makes senseOkay.\", \"That\\'s not gonna happen.Okay.\", \"Okay.Okay, that makes sense.\", \"Okay.OkayYeahOkay.\", \"Okay.Yeah.No.\", \"So, like, if I told you that I was feeling really sad, and I thought about killing myself, you\\'re

because I also, I have to lock my door, but I like to lock it 12 times.\", \"So I\\'ll put the key in, and I\\'ll hear it click, but then I just like doing it 12 times just to make sure it\\'s

time I got done turning them on, and just make sure they were offand get back in time on the floor.My employer just said I wasn\\'t a good fitYeah.My anxiety is really bad.Probably, like a 10Yeah.a little bit.Yeah.It\\'s just, I guess when I\\'m in the act of doing it, it will relieve it.\", \"And that\\'ll be okay for a little bit of time.\", \"But even coming in, you know, like I said, when you have chairs and some pictures, and I just like I had to touch them, like, had to touch the chairs.\", \"But I wanted to touch the chairs first, and then the pitchers.\", \"And that\\'s normally what I do.\", \"I\\'m in a room like I have to touch the chairs first.\", \"And I feel okay when I\\'m doing it.\", \"And then when I\\'m finished, I feel a little better.\", \"But then it comes back things.Probably since, I guess like third grade.And started off with a little bit of things like I would just get a little bit of anxiety.\", \"I just went on to play with the doorknob.\", \"And then as I got it went away for like a year.\", \"Maybe and then I would start to play with the lights and just make sure that they were off.Yeah.My parents didn\\'t really like it.\", \"They kind of were

feel that Yeah.Yeah.\", \"Well, I just feel really alone most of the time, and even when I\\'m with people, I\\'m still just so by myself and I feel like no one cares or even notices when I walk into a room.YeahI don\\'t know,  sadness.A little bit.Well, it\\'s like, I feel like I try a lot of the time really hard to, to make efforts bring people together.\", \"And even when I\\'m in a group and I\\'m formulating something that it\\'s like the whole group ends up clicking except me, and I\\'m always on the outside of it.At work, I feel like we\\'ll be having a meeting or something and I end up going into my head about something and then I\\'ll miss the conversation and then everyone will start laughing and then you know, I will not have any idea what just took place I don\\'t know, it happens, it would happen in grade school playground stuff.Oh, one the third grade, I tried to formulate this cheerleading group for this flag football that the boys did and I put the whole thing together and we went down to the field to present our new chairs and then the flag football guys, they really liked it but they said okay, we want to take everyone except you.\", \"And it was my idea.\", \"And I was bet one who ended up being on the outskirts again.\", \"And I really tried that time toYeah.Have a seat.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Hi.\", \"And so we just talked on the phone.Yes, yes.\", \"I saw Joe Dr.\", \"Donovan.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And he did that scan for gall stones.I went for that scan and then I was a bit surprised actually, they actually rang me up and a few days afterwards and said that I needed another scan to check things out.\", \"Okay, so I was there.\", \"It was on Monday this week.\", \"Don\\'t let anything then.No, no, it was the it was a nice old sound girl who rang me saying they were booking this disappointments for this extra scan.No, they didn\\'t actually I mean, I try to ask you always do and play sweet talk lady, but she was not pretending.\", \"I guess it was gallstones.Right.all started a few months ago Ray with his tummy pain.And then I saw your colleague, and he said we better get a scan.\", \"Yeah, I went for that scan.\", \"It was only about two weeks ago.\", \"And I got literally four or five days later.\", \"got the phone call?\", \"I needed this additional scan.\", \"So I went on Monday.Yes.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s just there all the time.\", \"YesReally?So what\\'s what\\'s the worrying thing that you found?suspicious?All right.That doesn\\'t sound good, does they?Right.Really?god.\", \"I didn\\'t expect that.\", \"God, I am only 47 cancer.\", \"Oh, yes.\", \"GodWhat\\'s the pancreas and I have got cancer.\", \"What can I can make can they cut it out?RightOkay.\", \"Okay.I just hasn\\'t expected that so.I suppose I could love

\"Okay.\", \"I like this.Well, I came to see Dr.\", \"Seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety, that\\'s kind of getting the best of me.\", \"And in the course of my appointment with him, he was asking how I was dealing with that stress.\", \"And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and, and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something.I suppose.He told me to fill that out and bring it with me.typically, yeah.\", \"wine with my meals?\", \"You know, again, one or two, typically and more frequently, three or four.\", \"My stress is increased.okayI feel the glass up so maybe a little more than thatThat news to me, you know, I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy.\", \"You know, no more than seven in a week?\", \"That seems kind of prohibitive?Well, you know, it does, at least in the moment, temporarily reduce my stress.\", \"And I you know, like a good glass of wine.\", \"I don\\'t don\\'t drink the cheap stuff.\", \"I like the expensive.Um, well, you know, the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kinda yaak and, of course, part of my stress is finances.\", \"And I mentioned I like the good stuff.\", \"And so if I\\'m drinking more than I\\'m increasing my financial burden,Yeah, kind of defeating the purpose they\\'reAnd maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress.\", \"Yeah.Well, I\\'ve exercised in the past and that helps.\", \"Right now.\", \"My schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don\\'t know what to do.\", \"That\\'s why I came to see Dr.\", \"seal.\", \"I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help.\", \"You know, when I\\'m feeling overwhelmed,Well, I mean, if if it means that it\\'s increasing my stress and or he\\'s not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking, then it\\'s fairly important, maybe about seven.\", \"Well, again, I got to get things under control.\", \"You know, My kids are dependent on me and I\\'ve got to go to work to help ease this financial stress.\", \"And so, you know, all those responsibilitiesWell, the you know, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can\\'t afford to, you know, have any more stress.\", \"So, yeah, hmmmI\\'m pretty confident and you know, probably about a seven or an eight I you know, I like a lot A glass of wine, I don\\'t want to quit altogether, I\\'d be willing to try cutting that.\", \"But now if it\\'s going to, if Dr.\", \"Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I\\'d be willing to do that at least for a period of time.Well, again, you know, if if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress, then then you know, I be pretty ready.\", \"Again, maybe about an on that scale, maybe an eight.Oh, I you know that the exercise but again, that\\'s that\\'s kind of difficult to fit in right now.\", \"I\\'m hoping that Dr.\", \"Seal will prescribe something for me to take when I\\'m feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of That would be niceOkayAll right, thank you very much.I am feeling wellYeahYeah I didI\\'m thinking about the therapy, now looking into some therapy lessons.drug and alcohol perhapsvery less mostly used honestly at least they go a party with my

think he\\'s got to the bottom of it.He\\'s not.\", \"There\\'s loads more he could do, I\\'m sure.\", \"Right.\", \"Okay.YesWell, it\\'s had quite, quite a big impact.\", \"I mean, the first thing the biggest thing, I suppose is that I, I went from being full time to part time at work.\", \"I just couldn\\'t sit all day comfortably.\", \"And so in part time, In the end, I hope about a year ago

\"I\\'ve got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say draw you in don\\'t do.\", \"I read a bit the old magazines but generally I\\'m at home.Last year My son got married.\", \"And I have to say I was worried that that I wouldn\\'t be able to cope with it that I wouldn\\'t be feeling well enough.\", \"But surprisingly enough, I was in good form.\", \"I think it was about three weeks in the summer getting ready for it and the whole heart of the wedding, but I was in good, really good form for that.\", \"Yeah.\", \"That was a good time.I hardly noticed them.\", \"Yes.\", \"It seemed to clear upwhich was good,Well, it\\'s I\\'m having a bit of a bad patch at the moment.\", \"It\\'s particularly uncomfortable.\", \"I have to say I do notice it when my husband\\'s away.\", \"He, he travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times A month And that\\'s not very often not good, then I have to say,Maybe I\\'m thinking about it a bit more.\", \"I don\\'t know when he\\'s not there.Well, he he thinks it\\'s all in my head.\", \"He\\'s he says it\\'s stress.\", \"Well, I mean, it can\\'t all be in my head.\", \"I hit too much physical pain for it to be in my head.\", \"I mean, it\\'s real.\", \"It\\'s it\\'s a real pain.Well, I mean, I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn\\'t cleared up in the early stages.\", \"But I think I mean, sometimes I think it\\'s IBS friend of mines got that and it sounds similar.\", \"And then other times, I think, I wonder if it\\'s an ulcer on a really bad day, I start to think it might be  cancerMy mother in law my mother in law died of cancer last year and she had a growth the doctor didn\\'t investigate that by the time they found it, it was the size of a football and it was it was too late to operate them.\",

looking at at the problem.\", \"You probably know about different tests and new tests that my doctor doesn\\'t know about, you know, new developments, that perhaps you could send me for some different tests.Hmm.\", \"Well, I think this, there\\'s got to be something that tests might reveal.\", \"So it\\'s like, do you think it\\'s all in my head that you\\'re going to be like Dr.\", \"Brown, you think I\\'m imagining all of this?Well, I can\\'t see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain.What sort of approach?Well, I just can\\'t do them.\", \"Yeah, I can\\'t do them anymore.Oh, I don\\'t know.What two, three months is a long time if there is something going on, I mean, that\\'s what happened to my mother in law, you know, they they left her and didn\\'t spot it andSo, what are

boss sent me over.There was this issue with a couple of the people that couldn\\'t relate to my ideas and my boss solid has been kind of, you know, not working super well.\", \"So she wanted me to come over and talk aboutUm, I think more just so that, you know, my ideas were just kind of higher than what they could really Understand, so maybe learn how to like how to talk to other people so that they can understand me.are higher, you know, just a little bit more intelligent, you know, I\\'m just at a level that other people can\\'t always reach to, you just, you know, like just a little bit higher, sometimes a lot higher, but just on this team, they just couldn\\'t understand, you know, my language or what I was saying, and it couldn\\'t see the vision that I had.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Um, I think it\\'s good, you know, so that my boss is happy that I went, but I think it could also be useful in the sense of, you know, other people are jealous of me a lot, and they just can\\'t really relate to me.\", \"So it might be, you know, great to learn how to relate, you know, like, kind of understand what they\\'re going through at their level.yeah, they\\'re just they haven\\'t they haven\\'t accomplished as much they have, you know, they don\\'t know as many people, they\\'re not hanging out with those prestigious ranks, you know, they haven\\'t been educated to the quality that I have been.\", \"So they just sometimes it\\'s hard for them to understand where I\\'m coming from, or you know, what I can see happening.Yeah, so I think you know, so I can even better you know, I\\'m here but I want to be like here.maybe like a seven but I want to like blow it out.\", \"The park, you know, like if 10 is here, I want to be higher than that.\", \"Well, you know, I\\'m always getting recruited for these really prestigious classes and to speak places and people are always calling I\\'m a really large social media presence when people are constantly asking me for advice, you know, just about everything, because, you know, I\\'ve just accomplished so much that I can really help people because I just, you know, I\\'ve just been really lucky to just be good at so many things.Yeah, yeah.Yeah.\", \"You know, like, sometimes people just, it\\'s hard to admit that you\\'re just not as good or like you can\\'t do it.\", \"Maybe you don\\'t want to admit that I think I make them uncomfortable because I can.Would they say?\", \"I think they would say that I have a lot of people that look up to me that I\\'m excellent at my job that, you know, like, I should really be vice Vice President, if not president, but I mean, I don\\'t own the company.\", \"But I should really have a more significant position.\", \"that a lot of the presentations that are happening that I could probably do, but they don\\'t want to, you know, other people need opportunities, but it would, it would be clear for everyone if I just did them.Yeah, you know, easier, better, more people.\", \"It would just be it would be a great presentation if I did it.\", \"So we\\'ll just cut away all the other stuff.Yeah,Right.\", \"Like if you know, if I was doing the sales pitches, we could blow it out of the park.\", \"I mean, we\\'d be multimillionaires by now.\", \"So You know, it would get rid of all that, you know, the grunt work type of stuff, if I just did it myself,You\\'re not recognized sometimes, but I\\'ve gotten really good at reminding people that they shouldn\\'t be calling on me for every task.\", \"Because I\\'m, you know, sometimes you just have to show them, you know, I\\'m better than that person, or I could do it better.\", \"And I\\'m really good at that type of communication.\", \"So I\\'ve been able to secure a lot of positions that weren\\'t given to me at first, because they realize like, Oh, she\\'s better at it.\", \"So they can see your talent.\", \"No I mean most of the time.\", \"YeahUm, maybe like six months, six months, maybe?\", \"Eight months.\", \"Okay.an AI algorithm.\", \"They, so I got it, I got it to a really, you know, large leadership position.\", \"And then, you know, the other VP couldn\\'t really see, see what I was going for.\", \"She couldn\\'t relate to me and she, you know, she, she wasn\\'t from the same type of like collegiate backgrounds that was kind of an issue.\", \"So I just outgrew what they had to offer.\", \"And then this company came in and made this tremendous offer with the you know, it was just, it was just fantastic.\", \"So I just had to make a move that was more strategic for me.\", \"And you know, that I could that I could even reach more.\", \"You know, I didn\\'t I didn\\'t want to be satisfied there.Yeah.Yeah.Um, well, I mean,They just said I you know, I talked too much or something like that, or I think there was an issue with somebody I was working with or something.\", \"But it was really it was another situation that just didn\\'t.\", \"We just we weren\\'t, we weren\\'t communicating well, but in the end I had to do what was best for me.\", \"So because afterwards they were calling me and trying to get me back, but I was already here so that I wasn\\'t gonna go back there.yet for them again.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Which I told them was gonna happen.Yeah, it was like you\\'re gonna you\\'re gonna miss me cuz I\\'m the reason this company is flourishing.the chargeback that I was had gotten a phenomenal job and it was way better and that they lost it and they could just deal with it.Yeah.\", \"And I, you know, I want to make my boss happy, but I feel like it would be good.\", \"You know, I don\\'t want to make people feel bad because they\\'re inferior to me.\", \"And because they\\'re not as successful.\", \"So if I could learn how to even talk with them so that I\\'m not, you know, so they don\\'t feel bad about themselves.I think it\\'s strongly encouraged.\", \"I think she has a promotion for me in mind.\", \"So it\\'s probably just to set me up for that.Yeah.\", \"Sure.\", \"Thank youI have a few friends but mainly have I meet friends as I move around a lot you know if I can\\'t pay rent at one place another friend will offer me to stay at their house but by the time we get there, there\\'s like seven other people.\", \"You know, they\\'ll be my friends until I move again.\", \"I mean, some of them are strong friends.\", \"Some of

way?\", \"Everything I told you, I would say Six, Well, it\\'s all about, it\\'s all about Henry at the end of the day, it\\'s it matters to me if I want to keep this engagement, and I will do anything for that man.\", \"So of course, this is what I have to do in this.\", \"This is him.\", \"Let him tell you, his relationship with me.\", \"And I\\'m with him is so much more important to me

nearby My house, I\\'ll be great.\", \"So I have to use gas because it\\'s expensive already to go to work and it\\'s far anyway.\", \"And I\\'m like, I guess, I guess it has to do with attitude as well.\", \"I don\\'t want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look in my drinking habits and all that, so I guess I\\'m just looking for a good vibe, you know, I don\\'t want to be judged or labeled..\", \"Thank you for listening to me.\", \"No one\\'s has actually sat down and talked to me about anything.\", \"I feel like you shed some light on an issue.\", \"So thank you.\", \"You\\'re very welcome really means a lot.Yeah, that sounds fine.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s okay.\", \"Two weeks work.\", \"Two weeks.\", \"Yeah.Okay, Yeahyeah.\", \"I mean, he\\'s worried that I\\'m depressed, but I am not.He told you that?Well, yeah, I mean, I had called I have called the police a few times because there\\'s something going on in my neighborhood.\", \"And it\\'s, yeah, makes me seem like I\\'m depressed but I\\'m not I just I\\'m concerned.\", \"about what\\'s going on.Um, well, it\\'s actually very scary, huh.\", \"There I know about.\", \"The government has been kidnapping girls in this area and taking them away for sex trafficking and prostitution.Yes.Yeah, yes.\", \"So, there specifically were two girls that lived down the street.\", \"And I saw a man Come come down the street and The girls were taken.\", \"And that\\'s when I initially called the police.\", \"But I found that they\\'re in on it to theYes.They tried to tell me that the girls were they\\'re safe and where they\\'re at, but I know they\\'re not.they pretended to, I know.\", \"I mean, I know it\\'s a lie.\", \"Because, you know, I saw that I haven\\'t seen a girl since like, I saw the girls on the street.\", \"The man came, the girls went out there.Andthey told me everything\\'s fine.\", \"But I know there\\'s a lie and I won\\'t go back to the police again, because I know that they\\'re now on it.I mean I know he\\'s, he\\'s worried about me.\", \"But, you know, it\\'s interesting to understand the severity of the situation.\", \"And, you know, it\\'s hard.\", \"It\\'s hard to sleep.\", \"I\\'m thinking about these poor girls.\", \"And, you know, it\\'s the government, like, the government has cameras everywhere, and they can watch what I\\'m doing it all times.\", \"And it\\'s, you know, it\\'s exhausting.\", \"So I can see how he would think I\\'m depressed.\", \"Because, you know, I\\'m bored.\", \"I, you know, I\\'m not sleeping well, and I\\'m not eating because what if they poisoned my food?\", \"You know, they\\'re poisoning water all the time.\", \"So, you know, it is scary and it is affecting anybody.\", \"It\\'s not depression.NoI\\'m sad for those girls.\", \"And I\\'m scared for, for me and like what\\'s going on?\", \"But, you know, I want to make sure that this doesn\\'t happen again because you know, I can\\'t let it happen.\", \"We can\\'t let this continue.\", \"So that\\'s, that\\'s what\\'s taking up my time right now.For a few months, a few monthswhen I saw the kidnapping?\", \"YesI mean, yes.\", \"I\\'ve always been aware that the government you know, is probably up just to things that they probably shouldn\\'t be and that they have access and abilities beyond, you know, the normal person.\", \"But after I saw the kidnapping, I had proof and so it\\'s it\\'s gotten worse because I feel like they know that I know.Yes.\", \"Because now I have proofYes.\", \"My dad has taken me before when he was worried about me.\", \"But I, you know, it\\'s never really been depression.\", \"It\\'s always been something else.\", \"Like, I\\'m fine.\", \"I just, I\\'m aware of what\\'s going on around me.\", \"And I don\\'t think my dad understands that I don\\'t think the places he takes me understands that.\", \"Sowhat have the people at the places where he has taken, you know, what have they said about your condition?Um, you know, they, they try to say the same thing that you know, I\\'m depressed or whatever, but, you know, I know I know the truth and sometimes I just have to play along.Yeah, because, you know, this is what the government wants, they want me to look crazy.\", \"So there\\'s nothing I can do about it.Because if I if, you know, it\\'s kind of like smearing my good name.\", \"They see me in and out of different agencies and appearing crazy.\", \"You know, obviously a lot of people don\\'t believe the story they choose not to believe where they get paid off.\", \"And they write what they write on my file but it\\'s not true.\", \"I\\'m just know what\\'s going on.Yeah, like lately Yeah.\", \"Like, you know, I haven\\'t been asleep, you know, and, you know, I feel guilty about what\\'s going on.\", \"Right.\", \"mean that I know and that, you know, I feel it\\'s hard for me to help them, like with, you know, cameras everywhere and I came to the grocery store without being watched.\", \"And I know they\\'re watching me so you know, I I do everything else was too, you know like I go to work I do the chores, because I have to make sure they see me going to work chores.Yeah.No.No, like I\\'m worried.\", \"No.I mean.\", \"I\\'m worried about the government, you know, destroying My life, you know, but I don\\'t want to die and I don\\'t think they\\'re going to kill me.\", \"I think that\\'d be too easy.\", \"And it would just be more proof.correct, because obviously I\\'m trying to tell people about it.\", \"And if I suddenly show up missing, like there, people are going to know.\", \"So I know that they\\'re not going to hurt me, but they could make me look crazy and I\\'m worried about my life.\", \"Like them worried in my life.No, nothing.\", \"I dont like to use those things.\", \"All right.NoNot really.No.I think that I\\'m aware of things that people but no likeYes.But again, it was I tried to initially tell my my dad about some things that I never knew about and he had taken me to the hospital but that was before.So really necessary today like, Can I come back another day?Well,I understand that\\'s what you need to do.\", \"So I guess that\\'s what the you know, that\\'s what we need to do to get this over with.\", \"That\\'s fine.I can play along,Okay,Yeah, I guess maybe that\\'s part of where it\\'s so hard for me is like, I know that I\\'m causing a lot of suffering for people.I guess not like it\\'s their actions, if they were doing the right things, even if I did come in their kids wouldn\\'t be removed.\", \"But it is still hard to be the one that pulls that trigger, you know.Yeah.\", \"That\\'s true.I mean, if they get with a good family, which, you know, usually they do.\", \"It\\'s, it\\'s good for them, you know, maybe it could be a wake up call for the parents, or if not, at least the kids are getting their needs met and stuff like that.\", \"It\\'s probably really hard for the kids and they probably want to go back to their parents.\", \"But I think overall, we wouldn\\'t be doing this if we didn\\'t think that it would be best for the kids to go to a place where they\\'re going to be taken care of.I guess not.\", \"It just feels like it is.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, I think so.\", \"And I\\'m not sure anybody else would have made a different decision either.No, I mean, not this feeling.\", \"But I do want to keep doing my job.Yeah, I mean, I guess I always knew I could make mistakes, but it just feels really real now, I guess that is the difference.I guess the biggest mistake you can really make is to miss some form of abuse or something like that.Okay.I mean, yeah.I i\\'ve never like feeling awesome.\", \"Really.\", \"But lately I\\'ve come to my awareness.\", \"But you know, I might be wrong.Well you know it\\'s nothing new but I have a lot of trouble sleeping Yeah, I usually go to bed early, you know, I might go a little bit late.\", \"But then I wake up always really early, like, I\\'ll set my alarm for like eight but I always wake up at like, five or something and then I can\\'t get back to sleep.Yes, I can\\'t get back to sleep, no matter how hard I try.\", \"And I\\'m tired still during the day.\", \"I don\\'t have a lot of energy, but it doesn\\'t matter.\", \"It just it\\'s hard for me to go to sleep.\", \"And it\\'s it\\'s been like that for a really long time.\", \"Probably since high school.\", \"But, you know, lately I\\'m just I realized, you know, some days are better than others, but so having a couple weeks here that really like made me feel like shouldn\\'t talk to someone Well, my brother got married and I\\'m very close to him.\", \"And I was really looking forward to the wedding.\", \"And then when I when I just I mean, I didn\\'t not enjoy it, but I just didn\\'t have as much fun as I thought I would.\", \"And I know it\\'s just because of my mood like that I\\'m always a little gloomy.\", \"You know, my sister, my brother says, I\\'m like, you\\'re so like, but I was really looking like I, you know, I step out of my comfort zone.\", \"I like to try new things.\", \"And I was really looking forward to this when I used to love I love weddings, you know, and it\\'s not that I don\\'t love them now, but I thought I would enjoy it more than I did.\", \"And that kind of like, freaked me out.Yeah, I mean, I would have thought that I mean, I\\'ve been looking forward to this reading for a year and a half I, you know, I helped, you know, my now sister planet, and it just wasn\\'t as fun as I wanted it to be.Or as I thought it would be, you know,Yeah, and like right afterwards, like last week.\", \"You know, it was I\\'ve more worst days than better days like I woke up early the next morning even though I had been up late at the wedding.\", \"And just sat there and thought about it and was really just upset by the whole thing upset that I couldn\\'t be more happy.\", \"Or, you know, my brother and for me really not even for my brother just because I was happy for him.\", \"just didn\\'t feel excited like everyone else.\", \"Everyone else around me was having such a good time and I was justYeah, like I was happier than I would be if I was sitting at home by myself, but I wasn\\'t.\", \"I wasn\\'t like everyone else.Oh, I mean, I graduated in 2010.\", \"So eight years.Yeah, I mean, I a little bit when I was in high school, I thought it was, you know, I was just a quirk or something about staying up late and like ours in high school, but it never Like I got better even when I you know started working out of school and stuff I mice sleep schedule never came to that normal eight hours a night like you\\'re supposed to I don\\'t know whatever it is, but it just never.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So sleeps always been an issue and I just like I said my brothers called me or for years just becauseYeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, I mean, it\\'s worse than that in the morning.\", \"Especially when I\\'m just like sitting there with my thoughts.\", \"When I can\\'t get back to sleep.\", \"It will be That and then you know we time to get ready for the day and I\\'ll be angry and mad that it\\'s, you know the I can\\'t sleep and then depressed about you know that I\\'m like this and I\\'m weird and then I mean as the day goes on I forget about it a little bit and it gets a little bit better in the afternoons and nighttime I really like you know, I enjoy spending time with my family for dinner and stuff like that.\", \"So it gets better as the day goes on.\", \"But, you know, in the morning it\\'s it\\'s bad because I just spent hours lying there thinking about it.Yeah.I haven\\'t really lost an interest in anything like I still, you know, I still seek out fun activities, and I still participate in them.\", \"And I mean, they\\'ll make me feel better than not doing them.\", \"But it\\'s just, I don\\'t know, it\\'s just I don\\'t.\", \"I guess my response to them isn\\'t as high as I see other people enjoying activities, and I don\\'t, but I do enjoy themNo one stays the same.No.No, Let\\'s focus on what I need to focus on.Yeah.No.NoNoNot really.\", \"I mean.Yeah, like there\\'s been times where I\\'ve like gone on vacation for like a week and I\\'ve noticed that I was happier than I had been, but nothing ever more than a couple of days or a week or so,NoNo.Okay.Yeah, Okay.Good, good how are you?Yeah.\", \"I mean, I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week, but but Jill was telling you about Jill, a co worker.\", \"And, you know, she was kind of bothered me the past couple weeks, but really, this this past week was like the worst, right?\", \"So she\\'s not doing her paperwork.\", \"And the thing is, is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports.\", \"So if she doesn\\'t have hers, I can\\'t do mine.\", \"And then I can\\'t get mine out in time for the next person to do theirs and it\\'s a mess.\", \"The whole thing\\'s a mess.\", \"And it\\'s just it\\'s annoying.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, it definitely is.\", \"And it it\\'s one of those things that like,you know, has, it gives me a bada bad evaluation, you know, like, if I\\'m not in my stuff in in time, the number reflects negatively on me, you know, and it\\'s it\\'s all kind of she\\'s she\\'s the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time.\", \"So she doesn\\'t, then I don\\'t then the next person and so forth, and it makes it seemlike you\\'re not doing her job,right?\", \"Yeah.\", \"And my boss doesn\\'t like it.\", \"my boss\\'s boss doesn\\'t like and so forth.\", \"You know, and I try to explain them.\", \"You know, she\\'s the problem, but it doesn\\'t always I don\\'t always have the time to go up and tell them like, here\\'s what\\'s happening or just somehow it doesn\\'t Now,Yeah.\", \"And that\\'s pretty annoying too.\", \"Because,you know, it\\'s one thing if people get mad at me, but then I\\'m able to tell them why I\\'m not doing my job, like I\\'m supposed to.\", \"But it\\'s another thing for them to get mad at me.\", \"Not realizing it\\'s not my fault.Yeah, I do.\", \"I do.\", \"That\\'s the thing.\", \"But I can\\'t always get it out.\", \"You know, I can always tell the person that\\'s has the complaint about and yeah, I mean, I\\'ve tried talking to my, my boss.\", \"And I\\'ve tried talking other people too, you know, but really hasn\\'t gotten anywhere.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, I mean,I talked to Joe a little bit about it, too.\", \"You know, and I tried to ask, I tried to kind of gently reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o\\'clock.\", \"I didn\\'t want to be real abrasive, you know, but I, I tried to remind him as a polite approach.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And it didn\\'t didn\\'t really seem to work because it\\'s still happening.\", \"You know,It really hasn\\'t.\", \"And, and that\\'s just, I feel like I\\'ve tried everything that I could try.You know, and even like, I came home and Iwas talking to a friend about it, andI was trying to think of other solutions, right.\", \"You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do what else I could say.\", \"Who else I could talk to things like that.\", \"You know, and my friend, you know, you He was listening and stuff.\", \"He had some good suggestions, but he didn\\'t know what to do either like cuz he doesn\\'t know the way the company works.So like, I got nothing.\", \"You\\'re not getting the help you need for this.Yeah, not at all feeling pretty lost with it.\", \"And I wish there was just like aclear way to do things like this is what you should do now.\", \"And I don\\'t see anything someYeah, yeah.But yeah, I don\\'tI don\\'t see a way to go about it.\", \"I mean I\\'ve so I\\'ve Okay, so this is the way I laid out in my mind.\", \"I tried talking to the people above me didn\\'t work out the way I thought it would.\", \"I tried talking to the people below me so to speak, just lower on the before me in the process.\", \"That\\'s what I mean.\", \"And that didn\\'t work out which is just Jill and I talked to her and that didn\\'t work.So like, there\\'s nowhere else I could turn.Yeah, that\\'s what it seems like to me.Yeah, it is.\", \"And I\\'ve been trying to wrack my brain.\", \"You know, like, what else could I do?\", \"You know, like, maybe if I could maybe if there was like, a committee or something that I could go to, you know, and be like, well, this person\\'s not doing what they\\'re supposed to be doing.\", \"But there\\'s not a committee like that.\", \"Or even if there was like a person, you know, like, a resolution person or whatever, but there\\'s nobody like that.It sort of seems like to me Yeah.\", \"I mean, that\\'sand you know, as I\\'m even trying to think like,I don\\'t know, should I Write a letter to somebody maybe.\", \"But I don\\'t even know who or whatYeah.Or like just something else that I can I can do instead of going to this person though to that person that didn\\'t work.Can I can Icall somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that?\", \"But I mean, there\\'s there\\'s HR people, butI can\\'t really see where they could come in.\", \"I don\\'t know how human resources could deal with something like that.No, I don\\'t.Wondering if there\\'s like aBut there\\'s I mean, I\\'m thinking now that there\\'s gotta be something or somebody, or somewhere that I could put in, like, almost like a complaint or something like, something\\'s out of my hands.\", \"And I don\\'t know what to do about it, but there\\'s got to be something.\", \"And now that I\\'m saying this, I\\'m thinking that there\\'s got to beYeah, yeah.I mean, now I\\'m trying to think back to my training, you know, initiallyyou know, maybe there\\'s, you know what, I think now that I\\'m, now that I\\'m thinking a little bit harder about a little bit differently about it.\", \"I\\'m thinking that there\\'s like, man, I forget what they call it now, but maybe like a complaint but It\\'s not the right word, but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something.\", \"And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting, which we have, like every other week.Yeah.\", \"And I\\'m thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it.\", \"But I\\'m thinking like, maybe that\\'s an avenue that I can use, you know, like, maybe that\\'ll get brought up.\", \"And maybe that\\'s something that that might actually work.\", \"Yeah, it could be.\", \"And then if it does work, it\\'ll get brought rather if they do read it, it\\'ll get brought up at the staff meeting.\", \"where everybody\\'s at my boss, my boss\\'s boss, Jill, everybody\\'s there.\", \"And maybe that\\'s a way for it to come to most attention.\", \"That deadlines being missed, affect other people in ways that you don\\'t really know about.Yeah, I think that\\'s, I mean, that\\'s gotta be the way to do it.\", \"And maybe that\\'s the best way.\", \"I really think.\", \"Yeah, I mean, after saying all that, and after going through that, I really think that that\\'s probably the best way to do it.\", \"And if it doesn\\'t, then I guess I can find another way.\", \"But I really think that\\'s the best way to do it.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And even if that doesn\\'t work, then it\\'ll be brought up.\", \"And maybe it\\'ll allow me to talk to my boss further about it.\", \"And maybe I\\'ll understand really where I\\'m coming from.\", \"But this will at least be a start to something you know, to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff inYeah.\", \"But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion.Maybe I won\\'t be as frustrated.I mean, I\\'m feeling a little less frustrated now.\", \"Even thinking if there is another option.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s,That feels like the right.Okay.Well, I mean, I\\'m, I\\'m curious about them because I haven\\'t been very well, right.\", \"I haven\\'t been very, very well.\", \"I\\'ve been last week I threw up some blood.\", \"Yeah, the first time.\", \"I mean, I threw up blood last weekend

just look headaches and I was justIt was a it was almost filling a toilet wasn\\'t that much.\", \"I wasn\\'t like that it was enough that I could see it in the toilet, and I was throwing up.Well, I was feeling sick.\", \"So and I had headaches and I, you know, I\\'ve got,I have headaches a lotthat was in the morning and then again,the other time it was sort of later in the day, but Iyou know, I also wake up in the middle of the night and I\\'m just covered in sweat.\", \"I know that\\'s another cancer thing.Actually, just before I came here,I had orange juice and I had some vodka in it.\", \"It\\'s the only thing actually that like steadies me enough to get out the door.\", \"I don\\'t ever go out that often.\", \"But right now,It\\'s just studies me studies me like I\\'m, you know, I\\'m shaking all the time.\", \"I\\'m just like,Five?\", \"Hmm, maybeI don\\'t measureSometimes if I\\'m feeling really like my stomach is really upset, I\\'ll drink cider.\", \"So that\\'s its cider or vodka becauseIn the last week?\", \"Not so much in the last couple of weeks maybe?I don\\'t know.\", \"Actually.\", \"I mean, I don\\'t know.\", \"I\\'ve got you know, I\\'ve got a lot going on.\", \"Right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So my, my sister is in Boston, she\\'s got cancer and I know like I should be calling her and I can\\'t do that.\", \"My mom is really sick and she\\'s horrible, and I\\'m the only one that Who can go see her?\", \"And I go see my mother and she just yells and screams at me and she\\'s got this email and it\\'s justYeah, yeah.I guess.\", \"I mean, I, you know, my days don\\'t differ that much.\", \"But I, you know, I\\'ll fall asleep in front of television and then I\\'m not seeing lots of people so I you know, there\\'s not big events in my life that I would be remembering.\", \"I just, you know, especially now that I\\'m feeling so not well, that Iyeah, there\\'s not much that I would have to rememberI did.\", \"I did.You know, I had a boyfriend whoyou know, was Sort of casual coming over and, and he, he basically said he couldn\\'t be with me anymore because I drink too much.\", \"And so I tried.\", \"I tried.\", \"I was like, Well, yeah, and then he left.\", \"So who cares, right?\", \"I mean, right?I feel guilty about my sister, right?\", \"I feel guilty that I can\\'t like I just can\\'t.\", \"I can\\'t even call her like I can\\'t.Right.\", \"Soif I, if I could pull it together than I could,Okay,I just been dealing with so much anger that I\\'m having difficulty controlling in my everyday life aLike for instance,I go to the dry cleaner, the pickup my fiance\\'s uniforms, and the lady had them like ball bag together and I mean, I could have easily just asked her because she separate them.\", \"But I begin to yell caused a big commotion because I was so frustrated and angry.\", \"She actually was about to call the police escort me out.\", \"And I don\\'t think I\\'m even allowed to go back to the driveway anymore.Yeah.\", \"My neighbor\\'s dog was barking late at night.\", \"I know my neighbors when they can\\'t control that.\", \"But I get into a huge fight with my neighbors argument.\", \"We\\'re not speaking at the moment and it\\'s just raw uncomfortable.\", \"But, I mean, I feel bad now that it\\'s over with none.\", \"I thought about it.\", \"And I just don\\'t know why I was so upset that the dog was work.No, I just it\\'s been going on for some time.\", \"Now.\", \"I just get little things just I just explode.So i don\\'t know whyNothing that I can really think of just when I\\'m overwhelmed.\", \"I have so much to do.\", \"I kind of just break down and just become extremely upset with everything around me.when I go to the go workout at the kickboxing class I\\'m like the go all out like I use that as like a release.\", \"I\\'m punching the bags of shame before I actually had hurt my wrist last week.\", \"I just go all out in there and my trainer kind of notices like are you okay?\", \"And I\\'m like it\\'s just relief kind of gained all the anger I had been out so.You are way more I\\'m like loud, I\\'m sweating bullets.\", \"I\\'m just going all out like extremely angry.Not really I just feel like frustrated does have so much going on at the moment.\", \"So it\\'s kind of like just feel overwhelmed, I guess not take it out.Yes, a whole lotMainly, mainly take care of home does not mean I don\\'t I don\\'t work or anything.\", \"So I kind of just take care of home and, you know, with the kids and everything, it\\'s just a lot.\", \"SoGuess all of the responsibilities allIt feels like all of them?\", \"Yeah.I\\'m cooking, I\\'m cleaning.Now I have to earn all of my husband\\'s uniforms and get everything ready for him.\", \"I had to make sure I cook breakfast I had to make sure I pick lunch.\", \"I had to make sure I have dinner ready income I had to help the kids with their homework.\", \"I just have so much going on like it\\'s constant, catering, catering, catering, cater and it feels like I just really don\\'t get a break or any other help is just made every day.Not always but it seems it\\'s been like this for some time.Everything.Yeah.structure, responsibility.repetition,conflict, power struggle.disagreements.Independence,freedomable to express creativity.of constant struggleextremely controlling.Seems like everything is like really controlled andstructured, A lot of it may come from my fiance.\", \"Now that I\\'m thinking about it.because I feel that he doesn\\'t give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the things that I would like to do like work, and I think he should help more with the kids around the house and do things and I shouldn\\'t have to do everything.\", \"And I feel like that\\'s probably why I\\'m so frustrated because I felt that I don\\'t have any help.\", \"It\\'s like I\\'m single, and I\\'m doing everything on my own.\", \"So this project where the bulk of my frustration is coming fromI\\'m feeling angry and disappointed.\", \"Like I don\\'t really know if I want to further anything because well it\\'d be like this forever just like angry, frustratedIt\\'s far worse than it but it\\'s like I think that\\'s where why I\\'m always so upset and angry.Yeah, cuz I feel alone at the same time completely.\", \"Like I\\'m not in a fair relationship is like I\\'m in control and I don\\'t have freedom to do anything.\", \"I don\\'t have help and it\\'s just it\\'s laying a lot of stress on me.it because honestly, I kind of I never really focused on that aspect of it.\", \"I kind of just thought that\\'s the way it should go.\", \"And I just thought I was angry because I just hate bad deeds.\", \"I\\'ve never really looked deep into it because I try so hard to make everything in my family, right.\", \"So I kind of really don\\'t pay attention, I kind of ignore it.\", \"But now that I\\'m thinking and pointing out different things, than into how I really feel.Definitely because I don\\'t think I would have like I said, I think I\\'m kind of try to hide it and really don\\'t focus much on it because I want things to be perfect.\", \"So they got a kind of ignore it.Yeah, definitely.\", \"Cuz I would just go off for no reason at all and just later to think about like, why did I even do it?I wasn\\'t sure at all.\", \"Why.\", \"But with that, I definitely could see the reasons why.Yeah, definitely.\", \"Definitely.\", \"It\\'s good.Alright, thanks.\", \"How are you?Yeah.Yeah.\", \"Um, for about the last six months or so, I have have this position at work where I have to make a weekly presentation to other managers about 10 people.\", \"And I, every time I have to do this, I lose it.Um, I, you know, I\\'m usually one of the last people to go and you know, as just keeps going more and more and more and more nervous.\", \"You know, it\\'s it starts where I feel, I feel like butterflies in my stomach.\", \"And that just becomes more intense.\", \"I start to just sweat all over.\", \"I feel if my face is turning red, my palms get really, really sweaty and you know, constantly wiping them on my on my pants, and my heart.\", \"It just feels like it\\'s going to just beat right out of my chest.\", \"And then I just I can\\'t, I can\\'tSo there\\'s, there\\'s about 1010 people, the the executive director and then the the man have different programs and and we all have to do just kind of like a weekly update report.\", \"So none of it\\'s very detailed, you know, just a maybe a few minutes each person to go around and just update everybody else on what\\'s going on.\", \"And all the different programs.\", \"We all take turnsIt\\'s usually just a few minutes, maybe five at most 10 almost or something, you know, major going on in my program.Oh, the day before?Yeah, I start to I start to feel nervous.\", \"Usually the day before is when I\\'m pulling together in my notes, I make like a look a few bullet points on stuff that I want to present that I think as relevant and so the day before, when I\\'m preparing that I start to feel nervous.\", \"And then usually last through the rest of the day into the evening, I usually don\\'t sleep well.\", \"That night and then by the time I get into work, I\\'m, you know, that\\'s usually when I\\'m, you know, feeling you know, really nervous by by the time I get into the meeting, I\\'m pretty much panicking.yeah.I I\\'m just becoming more and more terrified.\", \"My like, I just I feel like I\\'m being just drenched in sweat.\", \"I\\'m, I\\'m breathing faster I and I feel like everybody notices.\", \"I feel like everybody can hear me breathe.\", \"I feel like everybody can hear my heart beating, that it\\'s just so loud that it\\'s like, any minute everybody\\'s gonna look at me and say what is wrong with you?Yeah.\", \"And and there have been times, especially recently really, you know, it\\'s, like I said, I mean, this has been going on for at least six months, but especially recently I feel like I\\'ve had to, like run out of the room.\", \"I couldn\\'t tell you.\", \"Yes, I have.\", \"I\\'ve ran out and couldn\\'t.\", \"I couldn\\'t go back in.\", \"I tried and my my hand hit the doorknob to go back in the room and I walked up.\", \"Good.\", \"No,Yeah, I felt okay.\", \"You know, in the hallway and then when I tried to go back in the room, it\\'s Everything justright back up again.\", \"Yeah.You know, after a few weeks in a row of running out, yeah.\", \"You know, my boss was like, I realize you didn\\'t make your presentation and, you know, I just I made up an excuse, like, I got a phone call or I didn\\'t feel good or, you know, I stumbled through some excuse, but I feel bad because I mean, this is my job.\", \"And I want to do my job.\", \"And I mean, how I\\'ve lived with this, I feel like forever, you know, because I, I had a terrible time making presentations in high school.\", \"I had a terrible time making presentations in college.\", \"And here we are again, and I try to be a professional and have a career and make a life.\", \"I can\\'t, because I can\\'t perform my job.\", \"I want to do my job.\", \"I like my job.Yeah.There was one time, actually the very first time I ran out.\", \"And I didn\\'t go back and nobody noticed.\", \"And then the second time, that following week, I started to feel that way again.\", \"And then two of my co workers to the other managers actually started to get into a fight.\", \"One of them wanted more money for their program for something or other and the controller was like, No, we have no money you can\\'t have it\\'s a nonprofit, so there\\'s no money.\", \"And it was it was like getting really intense.\", \"And I don\\'t know what it was.\", \"I just, I was fine.Yeah, I guess it just, I don\\'t know.\", \"It just didn\\'t I, I felt I felt fine.\", \"I felt normal.Yeah, I\\'ve there been a couple times where actually I\\'veI\\'ve I\\'ve purposely gone in late hours that I\\'ve had car trouble and a habit and I\\'ve just gone in late or I\\'ve actually just called in sick for the day.\", \"There was twice I sent somebody else in my place, saying that, you know, when I was sick, but I mean, it gets noticed.no, no, I want to do my job.\", \"I really like my job.\", \"I really do.\", \"And I like where I work.\", \"And I like the people.\", \"But the thought of making these presentations every week just terrifies me.And I don\\'t want my boss to regret putting me in thisposition.\", \"I don\\'t want to disappoint him.\", \"I mean, I know he took a big chance, you know, putting me in this position.\", \"You know, I don\\'t have a lot of experience doing this.\", \"And there were, you know, potentially there could have been other people that were better qualified, but you know, he chose me.\", \"I don\\'t want to let him down.\", \"And I feel like I am every week with this meeting.Um, I guess I mean, I\\'m not sleeping the night before the meetings.I, I have started to drink a little bit to try and take the edge off.\", \"A friend of mine has said before that it\\'s something that she\\'s done to, to help when she\\'s nervous.\", \"And so I\\'ve, I\\'ve tried a shot or two before going into my meeting and I\\'m probably not a good effect.\", \"I mean, I was I was able to sit through the meeting, but everybody kept asking if I was okay.\", \"So I got up on theYeah, I really feel like they weren\\'t.\", \"And of course, I was very I didn\\'t want anybody to get close to me because I think it\\'s going.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I just, I was too scared to do that, again.I\\'m miserable.Every time I think about, you know how much I must be disappointing my boss.\", \"I just I feel so I just feel terrible.Yeah.Great.\", \"How are you?I mean, I don\\'t know why because I mean it\\'s been awesome for like a week I\\'ve been getting so much done.\", \"You know at work, I finished both reports that I\\'ve been working on.\", \"And even at home, like I\\'ve had tons of time to clean my house and get caught up on actually making my house what I want it to be and just Working on in general and it\\'s clean.\", \"And I mean, I haven\\'t had any issues.I mean, they have.\", \"I haven\\'t been sleeping as much.\", \"I haven\\'t needed it really.\", \"I only need a few hours, it seems like but it\\'s been fine because I haven\\'t been tired.\", \"I haven\\'t been, you know, irritable or anything during the day and at night, I get a few artists late, but the rest of the time I\\'m like, you know, either working on work or my house or whatever.\", \"So I mean, I\\'ve slept like in less but it\\'s not an issue.Okay, yeah.No Not really like that.Yeah, I mean, so my daddy room, I feel like more in new China and stuff like that.\", \"So I\\'ve gotten everything set up.\", \"You know, I hadn\\'t finished unpacking all my boxes from when I moved in.\", \"So I\\'ve gotten all the boxes on packed.\", \"You know, even like things like placemats and whatever, like, it looks like a home now and I\\'m really liking what I\\'m doingYeah, well, so I on the weekend, I had gone ahead and when shopping and I kind of went on a shopping spree.\", \"And I had bought, like I said, my new China and I got some kitchen utensils too and a couple things for around the house like home decor.\", \"And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything I was at the mall.\", \"So I was hitting a lot of different stores.\", \"And I\\'ve run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get a new dining room set like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet and he has an SUV.\", \"So I called him to see if he could come in so I could purchase the items but he said he wasn\\'t he couldn\\'t come out and I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money.\", \"Which I don\\'t know.\", \"I don\\'t know why he would be just from me calling him but I think that\\'s why he was concerned it but he didn\\'t come I didn\\'t get the dining room set or anything.I don\\'t know exactly, because there\\'s lots of different stores.\", \"But, you know, I have a couple different credit cards.\", \"So one credit card I used was declined by the end.\", \"So it was probably, you know, I didn\\'t need to get the dining room set.\", \"I could have used a different credit card, but obviously it\\'s been enough.I never really go on shopping sprees.\", \"And I really treat myself like that.\", \"So I mean, yes.\", \"But I again like I haven\\'t, you know, I needed all those things that I got from my apartment.Not like this.\", \"Now is the first time I\\'ve just feel like, you know, life\\'s falling into place right now.I doNo, no.NoNONoNo.I mean, I have been depressed in the past.\", \"Yes.\", \"Yeah.\", \"But I mean, I feel like that\\'s, I feel like it was it was a different person.\", \"And I feel like, you know, I haven\\'t had any of those symptoms.\", \"You know, and I feel like it\\'s a new meNo, no.No.\", \"I mean, I\\'ve talked to people before about being depressed.\", \"But I was never hospitalized for it.Yes.No,NOOkay.\", \"All right.Okay.good.Better?Well, last time we talked about thatthat um, and I think you wanted 10 minutes for me to put it off 10 minutes.\", \"Yeah.\", \"SoI did better.I think I ended up only doing like join a half instead of two I was able to put offered, I think, the 10 minutes a couple times.\", \"And then there were there was, I think one or two days where I went out for a walk because I was Tired of staring at the clock waiting for the 10 minutes to pass.\", \"So I got up, went for a walk.\", \"And then I passed one of my friends.\", \"So I ended up walking with her.\", \"And I actually didn\\'t get back to my house for like an hour.\", \"So I kind of put it off for like an hour because then I came home and took a couple hits onIt was rough.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, I found I actually talked to a couple people on the phone before I knew it like half hour to come by.Kind of Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I guess I just wasn\\'t thinking about it.No, not really.\", \"I mean, it\\'s I don\\'t see it as a problem.\", \"It\\'s it\\'s legal in a lot of states now.\", \"And I mean, it\\'s not that bad for you.\", \"It doesn\\'t really endanger me much.Yeah, I mean, I\\'m not hurting anybody else.\", \"Yeah, two to three months.Yeah, I mean, my parents are pretty cool with it, like they know.\", \"But I mean, I\\'m at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and move out.\", \"But I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I just, it\\'d be nice to have that job.\", \"Like, it\\'s a really good job, but at the same time, like, I don\\'t see why I have to sacrifice something that I like.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, it\\'s pretty accurate.it\\'s difficult.\", \"I thinkthink Ithink it like 15.\", \"Okay, between 15 and 20,I\\'m like,almost closer to 20 times I guess, otherwise, I probably would have kept going smoke more.\", \"I mean, there were a couple times where like somebody would call me or somebody would text me and that kind of distracted me and so I was able to put it off for a little bit.Yeah, Was it bad I don\\'t know.\", \"That seems kinda.\", \"Yeah, that seems like a longer timeI don\\'t know about that.Maybe like 15 minutes,I think I could try a little bit more than 20.binge watch TV,Yeah, I can do that.Yeah, it doesn\\'t make it any easier, but it\\'s tough for you.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"No, I definitely see how helpsMaybe we\\'ll see how the 15 goes, seeYeah.Yeah,

and going out and having that drink.\", \"Like I just, it wasn\\'t deserved, and I just felt like such a loser because I should have that was the time that I should have been at work.\", \"If I had a job and instead I was at the bar drinking.\", \"So I had one drink, and then Ellen two Do another because then I just felt worse.\", \"And I figured I had one.\", \"So come on.I think I lost track after four or five.I did really well.\", \"I it was, I think like three weeks,I felt like a loserfelt like a loser.Yeah, yeah.I mean, now I just kind of I don\\'t I\\'m afraid to go back like I\\'m afraid to go out with, like some friends.\", \"They invite me out to dinner.\", \"But I know there\\'s alcohol.\", \"AndYeah.Yeah, that\\'s pretty accurate.Just like shameful.\", \"Like I did really, really well.\", \"And then here I was.\", \"I just finished a drink and I knew I wanted another one.\", \"I guess just I was doing well.\", \"And then I had a drink and I just felt like an awful person.\", \"So I figured what was the hurt Having moreYeah, Yeah, absolutely.\", \"As I was finishing and then finished,I already messed up, I might as well keep going.\", \"I think that they had a rough day or something was to happen whereI mean, it\\'s just wondering,That\\'s just they made a mistake.Yeah, I think irresponsible,No.Yeah.It was my mistake it was in it.\", \"It makes me a worse person for doing it.shameful.\", \"I mean, irresponsible, which is bad overall.I think we could be separated But it, it feels like we\\'re like I am that behaviorYes, Yeah I mean, just because you have one drink doesn\\'t make you a horrible person andokay.Mm hmm.I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, difficult because I like being around those people.\", \"But I guess it would be it\\'s risky.guilty, kind ofYeah.Yeah.Kind of Yeah.OkayOkay, Yeah, I think that would probably be beneficial.Okay.Yeah, I think I can try that.OkayTerrible, it would feel like, you know, I had a role in that kind of thing happening to somebody, like I was partially to blame for somebody being harmed.\", \"And that is like the exact opposite of what my job is supposed to be.I don\\'t know, I mean, I\\'d like to think that I guess it\\'s not possible to make that kind of mistake, but I think that that\\'s naive.\", \"I think it is possible.\", \"And I, I would like to learn from that, but I don\\'t know what other people would do.\", \"Like I don\\'t know if I would lose my job or anything.I would be thinking, I don\\'t know how this will ever be better.\", \"I don\\'t know how I\\'m ever gonna feel okay about what I did.I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I guess ideally, I would say to myself, it\\'s going to get better.\", \"You know, this will pass and everything but I don\\'t know.\", \"It\\'s just hard.I think I would probably Take some time off.\", \"I mean, it\\'s just like I would be so stressed afterwards.\", \"And worried I would make another mistake because I\\'m so stressed out and having trouble focusing.Yeah, I mean, I guess I never thought about it like that, although that makes a lot of sense.\", \"Like it.\", \"If I, if I just calm down and try to let it go, then I\\'ll do my job better and I won\\'t have that risk as much.\", \"But if I keep feeling like this, I\\'m not focusing and then I could make a bigger mistake because of it.Great.\", \"How are you?I\\'m doing awesome.I, I think he\\'s worrying for no reason.\", \"Because I, you know, I for the last like week and a half, I have been following my passion, which is baking.\", \"And I didn\\'t realize this before, because I worked in an office.\", \"And I just realized that that\\'s not what I want to do with my life.\", \"And I know what I want to do with my life now, and I\\'ve never known before.\", \"So this is an amazing feeling.\", \"And what I want to do is I want to start my own baking business.\", \"And so what happened was That a couple.\", \"Two weeks ago, my nephew had a bake sale.\", \"And I\\'ve always I\\'ve always been like baking, but I\\'ve always been like from the box or like from, you know, whatever.\", \"So I tried for the first time making brownies from scratch and they were amazing and everyone loved them at the bake sale and they sold out.\", \"And my nephew thought I was a hero, basically, I was and so now it made me realize like I could do this for a living and it would make me feel amazing and make me feel like a hero for all these people.\", \"And like my college campus would be kind of cool if I could like put up something about like delivering the bakery like the dorms or like big goods to dorms because you know, college students love that type of thing.\", \"But so anyway, so I was thinking about long story short, having this business and I would bake all these cookies and I was gonna put up flyers because I don\\'t I\\'m not like at the point where I can get like an office space but I don\\'t need an office space because I have my apartment and I have everything I need in my apartment to bake everything I need.\", \"And I can also have a BJs membership.\", \"So Go to BJs.\", \"And I can get everything I need in bulk.\", \"So like all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff.\", \"So it\\'s not an issue if I just do it from my apartment.\", \"And so I was putting up flyers and trying to promote my business and has really been working on for the last week and a half, and I feel great.\", \"And it\\'s amazing.\", \"And that\\'s basically it.Okay, so there\\'s a couple that with that.\", \"So with the spending, like I don\\'t think my brother recognizes that when you start a business like you need to invest in it to begin, and I understand why he\\'s worried because like, so at work well at the office job that I had, like I got in trouble and because I obviously you need to make fires and I was like, oh, like he doesn\\'t realize I\\'m frugal.\", \"I\\'m smart.\", \"So I was like I\\'ll make the fires at work.\", \"And put them out of the work computer.\", \"So that I\\'m not having to pay like, wherever, like staples or something to go and print them out for me.\", \"So I got in trouble because it was like for personal use, and I was using like the, the work, whatever.\", \"But like that\\'s what annoys me about it because like the new guy that I met, which is the other thing with the relationships, like this new guy is so supportive of my ideas.\", \"I met him actually in a bakery, which is like destiny.\", \"And he was so supportive when I told him about what I was planning.\", \"And actually the other guy that I was talking to before, and I\\'ve been talking to him for a while, he was kind of like my brother and was like, are you sure this is something you want to do?\", \"And like, I don\\'t understand why you would say that someone who\\'s obviously sure of what they want to do.\", \"Like, I know I can do it.\", \"I know that I\\'ll be successful, like, did they not taste the brownies at the bake sale?\", \"Like they were amazing.\", \"And so that\\'s kind of where I am and that\\'s why my brother\\'s worried but he shouldn\\'t be because like I have all this played out.I mean, I\\'ve hooked up with him a few times, like I know him pretty well.\", \"And I don\\'t think he understands like the connection that we have, I guess a pretty strong one.No.\", \"And like, he doesn\\'t like, pay attention to me when I talk.\", \"Like, I\\'ll be trying to tell him about, like the bake sale and or not the bake sale.\", \"Well, a little bit about the bake sale, I can try to tell him about how successful it was.\", \"And he just thought that I was like, bragging, but I wasn\\'t like it was genuinely, like a success.\", \"And then I tried to tell him about my business idea.\", \"And like, he\\'s like, trying to like brush it off.\", \"Like it\\'s not a good idea.\", \"And that\\'s why so he just doesn\\'t listen to me.\", \"So sometimes I try not to talk too much about it.I haven\\'t been sleeping as much but I think that\\'s just because I\\'m so excited about this and like so.\", \"I\\'ve been like staying up late and waking up early and like looking at recipes, and honestly hasn\\'t really been an issue because I haven\\'t been tired at all.\", \"I was really The I haven\\'t eat I felt rested.\", \"I get enough.Nolike I\\'m not gonna have sadness when you\\'re following your passionYeah, yeah.\", \"In the past I have been actually, not too long ago, about four months ago I was I was hospitalized because I was so down.\", \"But, you know, and I, I don\\'t feel like that now.\", \"And I know what it feels like to be down and I don\\'t have any of that stuff.\", \"Like I feel so much more hopeful and happy and just great with where my life is going right now.noHonestly I just think it\\'s like getting to know myself and getting to know like what I want to do which is this you know, culinary artsfor the better for like really for the betterpretty bad like I it was like a final written notice so if any little thing at this point could make me lose my job but I\\'m not too worried about it because at this point I\\'m putting so much time into the baking business that if something goes wrong with my like office job, like I\\'ll have this like in I\\'m sure that in as short as a month like I\\'ll, I\\'ll be making money soon.\", \"And a lot of money because I know how much time I\\'m going to be putting into this how passionate I am about it.\", \"And I know that like I\\'ll be able to make the money back that I\\'ve put into it.\", \"So I\\'m not worried about itYeah.NoNo, I guess that\\'d be fine.You\\'re welcome.Yeah, really makes me feel really anxious.\", \"Like, what I look like and what people are thinking.Yeah.I think obviously the shaking I think my hands and legs shaking and kind of going really red and sweating and just looking great.\", \"went ahead.like, I think I just looked really obviously weird and out of place and like really read and just visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people.And I guess like when I\\'m holding the camera, I just grip onto it really, really tight, or kind of clench on my muscles and just find something that I can focus on.\", \"And to kind of try and make myself shake less and not goes red and stuff.No.\", \"I just tend to just look down.I just as I like kind of looking down and like wearing all black, so it\\'s less obvious and what kind of worrying?\", \"Yeah, just more layers and all black says you just can\\'t tell.I think it would be so much worse.\", \"Yeah, I think I just would just check even more and be more anxious and look of more obviously, kind of weird and out of place.And I just kind of all just like fumble and like kind of just clench, whatever, whatever it is, I\\'m holding just really tight and just make sure I don\\'t make any eye contact at all, just kind of get through it.Okay, Okaytry my best.Okay.Yeah.\", \"And there is my phone.\", \"Okay.OkayRight.\", \"Okaymaybe like a client at work?\", \"I always have to sit down with clients before we did the shoe and kind of get to know a little bit more about what they want.Yeah, Yeah.I am shaking, like being really obviously shaking and Okay, bright red and Okay, so,90like I really readYeah.probably like the chairs.90 have 100 Okay.worried to be fake, like say something stupid and not be able to kind of get what I\\'m trying to say across properly.Probably like, similar 90.\", \"Okay, I\\'d sayI think you\\'ll probably be able to see that I\\'m sweating and okay.Again, 90.I think it will be even worse.\", \"I think Oh, yeah.Twice as bad.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah.Oh yeah.\", \"Should I just use this?Okay.photography.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And what kind of kind of what kind of things you see and how you want it to be like,yeah.\", \"Do you want it?\", \"Like, do you kind of see it being outside?\", \"Is that something that you\\'re interested in?Yeah.\", \"And yeah, that\\'ll be.\", \"I\\'ve done quite a few things like that before.\", \"Yeah, I recently did some shoots outside kind of in like a word environment so that I could show you that maybe it would kind of help with some ideas.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"And what kind of thing are you looking at?\", \"How do you want it to be like,okay.\", \"And are you interested in having things outside maybe and he said it was he wants to It\\'s been natural.Yeah.Yeah, actually, it\\'s kind of a lot of the things I do are outside and I\\'m really interested in getting natural shots.\", \"So when I could change some of my work, and we could kind of see if we could kind of develop something from that could be quite good.\", \"Okay.\", \"That\\'s weird thing.Definitely not as much as I thought.\", \"I think it\\'s obvious that I\\'m obviously quite anxious, but I don\\'t think you can tell them shaking that much.And maybe like, less than 30.Not really.\", \"Actually, definitely less than I thought.\", \"Yeah,not as much.Not really.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah, thought was gonna be a lot worse thanMaybe like, less than 10 maybe.Not really.\", \"Definitely not as bad as IMaybe again, less than 10 I don\\'t think you could tell at all.Yeah.It was actually probably better when I wasn\\'t doing any of those things.\", \"I think I looked a lot more natural.\", \"And I was able to say what I was trying to say.\", \"I think it just come across more personable when I\\'m not kind of looking down and stuff.Yeah, I would not to call it difficulty.\", \"My husband?\", \"I\\'m having a little bit of trouble with anger or something like that.\", \"But to me, it\\'s like,My husband thinks so.\", \"But to me, I\\'m just fine.\", \"He\\'s just a yellow little here and there and, and but he\\'s a man.\", \"He\\'s get over it.\", \"He\\'s bigger than me stronger than me.\", \"I got Look, it\\'s the way I get my point across.\", \"That\\'s what I gotta do sometimes.it\\'s how you communicate.\", \"If he\\'s not happy with it, that\\'s about it.\", \"He\\'s gonna have to deal with it.He says this all the time.\", \"But to me, it\\'s what I do.\", \"If I want him to take the trash out.\", \"I tell him to take the trash out.\", \"He says I yell at him, we get into a fight over it.\", \"Just an argument over it.\", \"Nothing serious.\", \"But he says it\\'s for everything I do.\", \"Getting the kids ready to school for school.\", \"He says I yell at the kids.\", \"He says, If I can\\'t make anything simple, I can just make a simple request.\", \"He says I have to yell at him.\", \"I have to start a fight.\", \"I say should man up.I don\\'t think it\\'s a problem.\", \"No.\", \"It\\'s justOh, mainly with the husband.\", \"You know, I almost got into an argument with the neighbor but we dealt with it.\", \"She told my husband, he agreed with her and well, he sent us get help.To me, it\\'s not a difficulty for him.\", \"It\\'s more of a difficulty for him than it is for me.I am here.\", \"He\\'s my husband.\", \"So I respect him.\", \"I want to make him happy.\", \"So I said I\\'ll goI don\\'t see it as a problem.he\\'s more of a problem than I am.I don\\'t think no problem.\", \"I don\\'t think I have a problem.\", \"He says it\\'s all the yelling and I need help.\", \"And he\\'s talking about do something about us.\", \"Alright, fine.\", \"I\\'ll see aboutFor him?\", \"It would be I guess, but it I think maybe we could try it.\", \"I don\\'t know.\", \"But it\\'s taught but it\\'s what I do.He doesn\\'t get what I\\'m trying to say.\", \"It could be something as he wants to do it his way we could be driving.\", \"Alright, No, honey, I said we want to go this way.\", \"Oh, wait, why are you going that way?\", \"No flow.\", \"And then we get into a fight in the car.\", \"Or okay, honey, that\\'s not how you do two dishes.\", \"We started as simple as that.\", \"No, you wash out.\", \"No, that\\'s not how you do dishes.\", \"It could be something like that.\", \"We get into an argument.\", \"It\\'s just over two simplest things.I feel like I have to get my point across.\", \"But he\\'s not 100% innocent and messy.\", \"And I\\'m like, it\\'s not my fault.\", \"I wouldn\\'t have to yell if you listen to the first time.spontaneous, want to plan to get into anargument with him?\", \"If he would listen.\", \"And we want to be fine so much.\", \"Things are fine when he listens.\", \"But then he says, I don\\'t know what it is the moment I try to tell him something.\", \"It\\'s just it just gets to me.we just start yelling just start fighting.our relationship could be better, if you will listen more, but yes.Nope.No, not not not alcoholic or drug addict, right?\", \"If you try to say that No,I am as healthy as a horse.If it will make him happy.\", \"I told him I would see a counselor so I will see a counselor.I guess I\\'m okay with it.All right.Yeah.Yeah.\", \"For the past, past, maybe a couple weeks, I guess few weeks.\", \"I have these morning meetings once a week at work, and I have to make a presentation.\", \"And every time I go to present, it\\'s my turn and I start getting.\", \"Start getting really nervous.\", \"Yeah, yeah, we all take turn,I\\'m usually the guy at the start of the meeting, because I know I\\'m gonna have to, there\\'s about 10 of us and I always seem to be one of the last few to go like, like six or seven, kind of in line to presentHmm.\", \"Sowhen I walk in, I\\'m usually okay and you know, say good morning to everybody and then my my boss calls means order.\", \"And that\\'s usually when it starts, like kind of starts like, maybe like butterflies in my stomach kinda.\", \"And then after he makes his report, and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to be faster, my palms get sweaty, and I just, I just start to feel really nervous.\", \"I\\'ve realized that I might be kind of I start to tune out some of the other presentations.\", \"Because I, I start to become focused on how I\\'m feeling.Yeah, Yeah, yeahBy the time it it\\'s my turn to present I start.\", \"I just, I\\'m almost like just almost shaking.\", \"Yeah, I noticed that my hands are a little little off.\", \"And so keep my hands down, like in my lap and just that.\", \"I don\\'t want anybody to see them shaking like that.\", \"And I have a paper in front of me that I just kind of read from.\", \"But when I start reading my my voice is a little shaky, and I kind of stutter and tripped over my words.\", \"And I just I feel like I\\'m not making good presentations and then it\\'s not looking good to my boss.Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.Well when I\\'m done it\\'s it takes a little bit for everything to calm down.\", \"But I I\\'m, then I\\'m consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he\\'s, you know, he\\'s regretting putting me in this position and that I can\\'t make good records or you know that I didn\\'t report the right stuff the right information to him and and so, it doesn\\'t really go away.\", \"It just it\\'s almost like my mind is shift someone I\\'m anxious about.Yeah.Yeah.Um, when you when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time, and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations.\", \"And I just, I mean, most people are afraid of public speaking so like half out that maybe that\\'s what it was.\", \"So you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn\\'t really didn\\'t really bother me letters.\", \"I figured it was just normal and always got you know, decent grades.\", \"On my presentation so it never really bothered me.\", \"So I really feel like it\\'s only been an issue in the last few weeks.Um I\\'m not sure if it if it has any bearing.\", \"My my mom, she, she I know she doesn\\'t like to speak in public.\", \"And I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations.\", \"School and, you know, shoots Oh, you can buy it on.\", \"It\\'s tiny.\", \"And, you know, so I don\\'t know if that means anything.maybeYeah, like after I do after I make the presentation at work, and then I do start feeling really sad.\", \"You know, like I said, because then I feel like my boss isn\\'t satisfied with my performance and that he\\'s gonna regret his decision to give me this position.\", \"And so yeah, it definitely makes me sad.\", \"I feel disappointed in myself.And now I have a drink every now and then it\\'s very very rareNo, no, I\\'ve I\\'ve managed to control it, I guess to where I can stay there.\", \"Like I said, I\\'ve kind of zoned out some times when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel like they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I\\'d become focused on on on what\\'s going on inside like my heart eating and the you know, my hands and so I can\\'t I zone out on them sometimes, but But no, I I pushed through it and I do my presentation.Yeah, times cuz I feel like you know I\\'m the newest member of the management team and so I feel like they\\'re kinda like what is up with this chick?\", \"I can\\'t she get it together but you know there\\'s there\\'s been one person who\\'s been really supportive and you know, she\\'s been like, Hey, you did great today and great information and things like that.\", \"So that kind of helps me feel better.\", \"But I guess at the end of the day to me, it\\'s really my boss\\'s opinion that matters because he\\'s my boss.I\\'m when I\\'m preparing Like that morning to go to work, and that\\'s one of those like, Okay, I got this meeting at nine.\", \"And I start to think about I like on my way into work and but I don\\'t, I don\\'t start feeling anything until I\\'m actually in the room.Yeah,

just feel like a probably shouldn\\'t go.Yeah.Now when they\\'re to fix it, or take care of it or make it better, like I put it on somebody else that have to do with that.\", \"Yeah.Maybe Yeah.Yeah.no, not really.\", \"Because it\\'s like, I want immediate access.\", \"Like, I want to be able to be right there within minutes if they need me.I mean, not it\\'s not as bad but yeah, there\\'s back there.\", \"Stay with us.\", \"For an overnight there\\'s some of the way up sometimes I\\'m thinking I should just stay home.\", \"Or I could be right in the same town sometimes that if I\\'m, I wake up at five in the morning, I just get up and go home because I just get really start feeling really anxious and I want to be home.When I work 12 hour shifts and I have to work the overnight I will most of the time Take my break and go there between the chuck on Pima Benson.Probably usually like six, seven hours into it just depends like now it\\'s getting dark so when it kind of gets dark and If I don\\'t leave the light on or something, I get a little anxious.\", \"I feel like I need to go home and leave the light on and, you know, just let my pets know I\\'m coming back kind of weird, but I know they miss me.\", \"And then but if I\\'m busy, then I don\\'t really think about it.\", \"So if you know if I\\'m busy at work, doing something I don\\'t really think about until I stop what I\\'m doing right, slow down and I\\'m thinking, wow, I got 10 more hours or eight more hours.\", \"Sometimes I go home, sometimes they don\\'t.\", \"Sometimes it\\'s worse than others.Maybe because I know I\\'m close.\", \"I can get there.\", \"I know I\\'m in control.\", \"We\\'ll be able to go there.yeah.It\\'s my perception,definitely, No, not yet.I don\\'t really take long vacations I\\'ve taken only I\\'ve only taken like two week long vacations ever.\", \"For like, five, six days, and I was fine.\", \"Well, same anxiety when I was younger.\", \"And now it\\'s more like long weekends or you know a night here or there I don\\'t really take long vacations but probably maybe three or four times a year I\\'m like go away overnight versus just not just a friend\\'s house like an actual vacation where I go into the city or somethingYeah, \\'probably since a teenager and he hasn\\'t stopped me I\\'ve always where every now I work more than ever I\\'m the more it doesn\\'t stop me from working the kind of overtime working three jobs doesn\\'t stop me and but I mean, like I said in as a teenager early 20s it did I would just be like, on my way out somewhere to go stay the night my boyfriend was like, Nope, I can\\'t do it not to come home.\", \"But now that doesn\\'t happen.\", \"And may not I may not go for a week long vacation, but I\\'ll go for a few nights.Oh, yeah.\", \"\\'Yeah.Yeah, I mean, it doesn\\'t like so it doesn\\'t really seem to stop me from working obviously, because I work it\\'s just the leading up to leaving for work orWell think about making sure I have everything I need for work, you know, don\\'t have, I usually take my dinner.Just gotta go to work.\", \"I just think about I\\'ll come home later.\", \"You know if I get a break.\", \"I mean usually I do especially if I do the overnight as I got downtime, so run home and check on and then I\\'m off to work and then I kind of forget about it.\", \"And then I said some lights is burned out not every night I come home and check off but some nights I just get started feel anxious and get thinking about them and I go on the trip.for now from out working with clients.\", \"Yeah, so whatI don\\'t dwell on it because my focus is with the client.\", \"So it just kind of think about it, I need to get home but you know, and I just focus back on the client, I don\\'t let it overwhelm me orit goes away.\", \"I mean, I want what I\\'m thinking about, but then it goes away.there\\'s something or Yeah.about older cats.\", \"I mean, he\\'s really old something cool.\", \"You know what if, you know he\\'s, something\\'s happened to hell I mean, I don\\'t honestly thinking I\\'m dying, but I think you know what he needs because he has he\\'s really old.\", \"So I do think about him.Yes.just comes naturally when I\\'m getting ready to leave.You\\'re challenging, you\\'re disputing that automatic thought, this be my own thoughts.I do tell them that I tell them thank them and I feel like them that well does someone want sometimes I run from me when I try to kiss them goodbye.\", \"And I\\'m like, Oh, no, what I have to go to work because you will have to eat.\", \"I know it sounds silly, but I do tell him that and then I kind of thinks it does.\", \"Most things.\", \"I think I didn\\'t realize that\\'s kind of what I was.\", \"But I do do that sometimes.Yeah, but I didn\\'t realize that\\'s what I was doing.\", \"But yeah, I do say that to myself to them.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, I can\\'t take care of them being left alone.\", \"Yeah, that\\'s true.\", \"I never thought of it that way.and then there\\'s times I think, you know, they\\'re just cats are probably the last to go on.Yeah.\", \"Well, sometimes sometimes sometimes after a 12 hour shift, yes, I have one of them.\", \"She won\\'t show me let me sleep the first hour, she literally were around again and stuff.\", \"And I take it and she\\'s mad because I\\'ve been gone, but she\\'s fine.yeah, that\\'s true.Yeah.\", \"And they don\\'t know.\", \"I\\'m worrying or anxious.\", \"They could care less like they don\\'t believe no, it\\'s not bothering them.\", \"I mean,And that\\'s just an animal person but I think they do but yeah, I probably give them think they have more feelings than what they probably really do.\", \"But they\\'re my kids I treat them as kids my kids are all gods are important too.\", \"Yeah,Yeah.That\\'s us.\", \"Because like I said, I kind of said these things to myself anyway, I just didn\\'t realize that\\'s what was probably lessening the anxiety because I do say that things those things to myself pretty frequently when I say I have to go to work, or else you guys won\\'t be able to take care of didn\\'t even dawned on me that that\\'sThat makes sense.\", \"Definitely, yes.Sorry.\", \"No.\", \"I mean, I\\'ve threatened to put a camera in the house.\", \"So I can like, there\\'s a thing you can, you can remote access to your house, and there\\'s a button your animal can push and call you.\", \"And I\\'ve talked to him at work.\", \"I\\'m like, Well, my cat calls me y\\'all.\", \"I really thought about it seriously, that I could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home, I could just look in and see what they\\'re doing.\", \"I have thought that some of my co workers know I can\\'t worry about them.\", \"So yeah, they would help support me and not be so anxious.\", \"Probably.but make it worse,Yeah, I\\'d rather do that.\", \"should I like try to measure my level of anxiety?\",

activities and things?Yeah, it was fun.\", \"Yeah, we just mostly are like doing some outdoor activities, maybe just sort of get some pressure kind of thing.\", \"Usually it\\'s not so like, you know, there\\'s more.\", \"They tend to do more healthy activities, I would say.Yeah You\\'re right there.\", \"It could be I might take my mind off of it.Was I really had a lot of second thoughts.\", \"I was worried about commitment and that kind of thing.\", \"So I didn\\'t feel like that was the right the right idea.a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I just don\\'t have the motivation to be

it.\", \"But like, I went to the first the first meeting, and I just felt like, like, those people were bought on the barrel and I was just not I just didn\\'t fit in with that crowd where they are not in that place.I couldn\\'t, I just didn\\'t want to stay.Right.YeahSee there could be some positive.\", \"I just don\\'t I don\\'t I just don\\'t see it that much at this point.Well, I would, I would probably be able to relate to people in the same kind of situation.\", \"And maybe it\\'s just a positive to be able to have connection with people like that.\", \"I\\'m not sure.Yeah, it would probably be the same kind of situation like Essentially, people in a support group are all there for the same goal.\", \"So it\\'s kind of like in hockey.\", \"Very important there to win.\", \"Mm

I\\'m at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer i\\'ll i\\'ll take sips every now and then.\", \"But it\\'s not something that I feel hovers around my life.I guess I would say like every other every other weekend, maybe every every two weeks.\", \"On occasion, maybe There\\'s a basketball game going on or a football game I\\'ll have a beer just to drink with my boys.\", \"But other than that, I don\\'t really see it as much of a of a problem.Yeah, I guess you can say that.When I\\'m not drinking, I\\'m usually more like, involved in doing like more productive things like I I try and do more schoolwork whenever I have the time or whenever I like I can go workout or something just to like, when whenever I\\'m drinking, I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friends.\", \"Okay,Yeah, I mean, I, whenever I\\'m drinking, I know that I\\'m devoting time to, to not doing other things.\", \"So I try and make it so that I don\\'t allow myself to pile on so much work.\", \"So I try and, like get work done before, but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity.\", \"So I try and minimize that as much as possible.Yeah, I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit.\", \"But just because like when I\\'m drinking, I\\'m, I\\'m not really focused on what I have to do.\", \"I\\'m focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that I have at that time.\", \"And it\\'s really something that I just it\\'s something of an like a pleasure givers like and enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing.Just the way that it, it\\'s sort of like liberates you and makes you it makes you feel like a more confident, more energetic person that you don\\'t feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself.\", \"And it\\'s something that you it, it\\'s just empowering to a degree.Um, whenever I drink too much, I sort of lose control of myself and I I just like the aftermath of whenever I drank too much or whenever my friends mixed drinks and it just has a harmful effect on my body.\", \"That\\'s probably one of the major drawbacks that I had from drinking.I mainly when when I puke or it\\'s just the the feeling that I get in my stomach, if I drink too much is just very overwhelming.Wow, I would say probablyat a friend, one of my friends had a birthday party recently.\", \"And he wanted to let loose was it was just the all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party and I just I lost it.\", \"I drank way too much I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along the way.\", \"I got to a point where I lost countI don\\'t let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night.\", \"Just because I know I\\'m, I\\'ve gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit.\", \"But I kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far I can go.\", \"And I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire, but I want to see how far I can go.\", \"Just so I know not to go that far.Yeah, just so I know how it feels now so that later on when this The situation is more drastic and more out of control.\", \"I know what I can do and where am I limit is it you?in terms of career wise, in termsand I would love to be.I would love to travel, I would love to see the world for what it is.\", \"And I\\'ve always seen pictures and videos of how the world is, but I\\'ve never really experienced that, like, I\\'ve always wanted to travel to Europe or, or China or something or someplace like that.\", \"So I can really experience the worldthat we live in.I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest.\", \"But I wouldn\\'t want to tamper with drinking too much.\", \"Like, often, just because I\\'m I know, I\\'ve seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly, every single day.\", \"I don\\'t want to ever get to that point.\", \"yeah, feel more in controlMaybe now that I know, my limits to an extent, I kind of don\\'t want to push it.\", \"So, so much.\", \"Now that I know what I can do and where I can go.\", \"I would like to mitigate that as much as possible.\", \"I just want to I want to have fun being me.\", \"But I don\\'t want me to be influenced by alcohol.\", \"So much.\", \"Like I want to live the sober life to an extent, but I know that alcohol is just gonna tamper with it.Yeah.\", \"And like not, like not drinking, like in the mornings or just just strictly for social purposes like not just to not have it around, like, I don\\'t want to have it like in my fridge, if my parents have it.\", \"I don\\'t want to I don\\'t want to have to deal with it.\", \"benefits andI guess I could definitely be, I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent like I could possibly be more productive, more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life.\", \"And I think that by not drinking, I will definitely have a better effect on my life.Thank you very much.my clinical psychologist has told me that I needed to see someone.\", \"I thought I didn\\'t need to see someone because there was nothing wrong with me.\", \"I just had a heart disease.\", \"And I, my heart disease had got so severe and I was just tired and there was no one that could make it better.\", \"By listening to me or talking to me, the only thing I thought that could heal me was heart surgery.\", \"And when he suggested that I see someone, it didn\\'t seem to make sense.\", \"But because I was so depressed, so far gone, I, my husband through my husband, I thought I try and just take a chance and just listen to someone or let someone Listen to me, because I wasn\\'t sure what it entailed.\", \"I\\'ve never been to a clinical psychologist before.\", \"So to me as a clinical psychologist was a shrink, you must have had something seriously wrong with your brain that you needed to see a clinical psychologist, and I didn\\'t need to see one.\", \"But when I did Mita and I realized that not being able to make up my mind by Waiting for surgery for heart surgery.\", \"I\\'m putting my name down on the list.\", \"I needed someone to help be accepted in order to get surgery done, because I didn\\'t want to get surgery done and she listened to me and to the way I felt and what was making me whoa, hold back on surgery and what made me feel the way I did.\", \"And funnily enough, as a woman, you tend to feel that you can cry on someone else\\'s shoulder.\", \"But for the first time, just letting my emotions out to her.\", \"She helped me cry and by me speaking to her, it helped me see myself from the inside.\", \"If that makes sense.\", \"I then I began to understand why I had to get heart surgery done wasn\\'t because I was tired but I had my family and everyone that went through the road with me of suffering was mad so I needed to get it done.\", \"And then eventually I did put my name down on the list not knowing it would be done so quick because asked was just supposed to take me six to eight months to get heart surgery done.\", \"But when I started seeing my clinical psychology, I understood it, I put my name down and I got my surgery done in 30 days time.\", \"So it sounds like part of the clinical psychologists role with you is to help you to make your decision around whether to get surgery or not.\", \"Yes.\", \"But you also said that you were quite depressed at the time was the CBT helpful for your depression as well, it helped because then, instead of crying and holding things back emotionally, it helped me let things out.\", \"And by letting things out, it helped me understand what I was feeling because most of the time we bottle things up, we never let them out or we never talk to each other, or other people.\", \"So when we bottle stuff up, it makes it harder for us to figure out ways to solve problems.\", \"Sometimes it can be a little problem and we turn it into a big problem because we just don\\'t communicate with other people or talk things over to make it easier to understand.\", \"And she helped me understand and I saw her before surgery right through my heart surgery and after heart surgery, and she helped me.\", \"By then by the time I started with heart surgery, I\\'d lost myself confidence.\", \"I was so depressed, I was so withdrawn.\", \"But after I had heart surgery, and I carried on seeing her, she helped me gain my confidence back again.\", \"She helped me gain my trust again, she helped me see that there was something worth loving for again.\", \"And a lot of times when I think of the things that are needed for me, it brings tears to my eyes and makes my heart swell up because I didn\\'t know another person could do that for you.\", \"By just listening to you, you know, like when we go to mom when you got a problem and you think no one can understand, but my mom can because she knows what I\\'m coming from.\", \"But it\\'s not to say that clinical psychologists are like that.\", \"But it\\'s just the way they listen to you.\", \"Just having that someone that can listen to you and just be there and be still be quiet and let you express yourself.\", \"That\\'s how and help you find out what problems are that you\\'ve got and help you solve those problems if they can.Dr.\", \"Penny was there with me every step of the way.\", \"With all the problems that I had, she helped me Show me that there\\'s an easier way to solve everything and not make a big problem out of everything.\", \"There\\'s always someone every step of the way that stayed to help if you need a helping hand.\", \"And that\\'s how I in by the time I\\'d finished therapy with her, I found out that clinical psychologists are not just strings.\", \"They are people like us and they do feel like us and it\\'s so much easier.\", \"To speak to someone when you\\'re having problems because we all do in our lifetime breakdown sooner or later.\", \"If you don\\'t have to be mentally ill, you can be in a car accident, any any problems in the home is something you can even have a death in the family that you can break down with.\", \"And you need somebody just to hear you how you feeling, because we all assume that somebody else naturally knows what I\\'m feeling or thinking.\", \"But it\\'s not that way.\", \"We all have differentin the beginning, I didn\\'t.\", \"I didn\\'t have any drawbacks going for CBT because I was so severely depressed, I needed it.\", \"And I found that they were people all around that would help me so there was nothing.\", \"The only thing that was stopping me was me.Yes.\", \"Don\\'t look at the word CBT.\", \"But look at the person behind it.\", \"Because sometimes we see big words and we don\\'t understand the meaning of those words.\", \"And we assume, but sometimes when we look behind the word, like clinical psychologists, I would have said a shrink and I would never have thought myself going to one because they deal with mental people.\", \"But it\\'s not that it\\'s, you can have suffered from depression.\", \"You can suffer from any kind of illness and it\\'s so good to go to a clinical psychologist when you need them.\", \"Because one, sooner or later in our lives, we will need one and most people when you know like when you find younger people that nowadays, lots of young people are going under so much stress in life.\", \"If you haven\\'t got a parent or a friend, and you\\'re suffering from depression, those are the right people to speak to because It\\'s good to be able to have someone in your life that you can talk to.\", \"Because I know there\\'s no one in my family that I can talk to.\", \"I always think my husband would never understand me.\", \"My kids would never understand me.\", \"When I go to the doctor, he never has that enough time for me.\", \"But with a clinical psychologist, they make that time for you.\", \"And they listen to you, you\\'ve got you\\'ve got that time with them to express yourself and you still got follow ups, they can check on you and make sure everything\\'s right.\", \"If you not, everything\\'s not alright.\", \"They can always check and find ways and means to help you.\", \"get you in touch with other people that can help you or get in touch with other people that are in the same.\", \"Having the suffering from the same conditions as you and you can swap ideas with each other to find and live a happier life.I would say maybe like judging.Yeah but I figured I could do better on the subsequent one but when people are have this opinion of you I feel like that doesn\\'t go away as quicklyI guess I worried that they would think I\\'m anxious because I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing or I don\\'t belong there.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Like, I don\\'t deserve to be in that program.they might write that maybe they think that\\'s why I\\'m anxious or that\\'s why I\\'m not doing well.I think you know, typically, I\\'m one of the top students in my program, and I\\'ve seen two Get the concepts pretty well.\", \"It\\'s just when I have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via, like a presentation or something, that I\\'m worried that, you know, maybe I\\'m an imposter or something, but so I start to question myself.\", \"But I think in general that, you know, I\\'m a pretty good student before this.\", \"And I\\'m doing pretty well in the program.Yeah, exactly.I don\\'t know.\", \"Maybe I am.\", \"Maybe I don\\'t deserve to be there.like maybe I shouldn\\'t be in this program.\", \"I think they should just drop out.Yeah.Depressing I feel like I\\'ve worked really hard.\", \"You know, to get through atleast halfway through my program.\", \"And it really hurts to think that that will be true.Now that I\\'m thinking about it here, I mean, there\\'s not a ton to support.\", \"But in on that day, I can think of all sorts of, you know, things to tell myselfSo maybe like I\\'m not prepared or because I\\'m messing up on the presentation that I\\'m going to get a bad grade and you know, if I can\\'t speak in front of people, how am I going to speak in front of kids as a teacher, you know, one day that it will translate to something else.\", \"I can\\'t get past this.yeahBesides My bad grade?\", \"Not a whole lot.Yeah.\", \"Which are really intense like panic almost in the moment.Yeah, definitely.\", \"I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program.\", \"Like there\\'s kind of like, a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff, which I passed, to get interviews and such to get into the program.\", \"So I did that.\", \"Like I said, I\\'m a pretty good student, all considering, you know, before this kind of flick was happening.I mean, now that you\\'re kind of like talking about it, like, you know, this or that sort of thing.\", \"It makes sense.\", \"I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty well so far.\", \"You know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you\\'re doing your performance, rather than that one gradeI think I tried to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really, like you were saying, your anxiety tells you sort of I think I can think that but I think my anxiety symptoms are such in the moment that it\\'s really hard.\", \"You know, and I\\'m replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again.I would say like, you know, a two or three like not very, I don\\'t believe it very much right now because You know, I\\'m not presenting and it\\'s just you and I not like a group full of people.\", \"So that pressure is not there here.Yeah, that is correct I don\\'t feel really confident.\", \"In that moment.\", \"It feels very real.\", \"Like, like any moment, they\\'re gonna kick me out.\", \"Like, I\\'m just not doing well.\", \"I\\'m stuffing.definitely now that anxiety that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there.Yes, I think so.I would say, you know, when I\\'m not at risk of presenting, like, I feel like I spend the majority of my time, like, it\\'s not something I worry about all the time, just leading up to and then mostly that day,right.\", \"Like my judgment is clouded.Yes, very troubling.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Exactly.Not very much on it.I don\\'t see the point.\", \"And I mean, how do you master watching TV or eating a meal?\", \"I, if I had tried to use chopsticks, I suppose it would have some mastery involved in but I, I didn\\'t mess with chopsticks, okay.\", \"Food was okay.\", \"Hmm.\", \"But not, not great.\", \"Okay.I don\\'t enjoy anything.\", \"And I used to I used to enjoy it a lot of things.\", \"But I don\\'t even I don\\'t look forward to breakfast, particularly cup of coffee.\", \"The news is mostly bad and what if there is news?\", \"I mean, the paper doesn\\'t carry much national news anymore.\", \"So, I mean, I have to eat, but I really don\\'t see the point of a lot of things.Well, that would depend on the activity.\", \"I know but okay.\", \"I could, I could get in touch with somebody I could call a friend.\", \"Maybe try to meet somebody for lunch.Well, I would, I would enjoy the company.\", \"Okay, and wouldn\\'t be as lonely I suppose.Company company and said not as lonely not only.\", \"That\\'s good, okay.Well, one downside might be that he wouldn\\'t be interested in having lunch with me.\", \"I haven\\'t been a whole lot of fun lately.\", \"And, or he might be busy and might not not might not be able to have lunch.he might want to talk about what\\'s going on in my life and I\\'m ready We don\\'t want to talk about that let somebody talk about it

cons.\", \"If, if I make the change if I don\\'t make the change I\\'ll be doing just what I\\'ve been doing and I\\'ll be getting up wondering, what\\'s the point?\", \"And well still be lonely.\",

\"And if I only have one thing I won\\'t buy it I\\'ll put it back or I\\'ll look around the store for another thing so that I have two things to buy.Ysometimes it can be more as long as it\\'s

buy that one thing that I need.daily,yeah, because I mean, if I go grocery shopping or if I go clothes shopping or for any kind of money transactional thing, you know, which I would encounter daily pretty much it happensOh then oh bipac accom.Yeah.Yeah, I guess so.\", \"Yeah.\", \"No.\", \"Or vitamins or number of transactions?\", \"Yeah.\", \"Because see if I get gas, then I have the gas in my

like, builds up in me and I feel it.RightYeah, I start.\", \"I start with what do I need?\", \"Why am I here?\", \"You know, I need a pack of gum.\", \"And then it\\'s instant anxiety that what else am I gonna get?\", \"What else can I get to make it the two?Yeah.\", \"So I guess the first thought is what else?\", \"What else do I have to get?\", \"Yeah.\", \"And then so jumps rightIt starts going down.\", \"Okay,Yes, but it is really it is really Yes.\", \"Once it completely gone.\", \"When I\\'m done thatabsolutely.\", \"All right.That would be fantastic.\", \"Fantastic.I would guess that.\", \"I mean, we\\'ve talked about you my dad had some bad experiences I had I sound awful.\", \"Yeah, they\\'ve, they were difficult.\", \"So I wonder if that\\'s not somehow linked to this

security.Yes.well, now that you said that, or you know, pointed out those safety security issues, I didn\\'t really realize that but it is.\", \"Maybe that just that I\\'m not okay, I\\'m notvulnerable.\", \"Yeah, I\\'m vulnerable.\", \"Am I an exposed?\", \"exposed to danger to?That\\'s my rule.When the situation andin tears.\", \"What else am I getting in?that follows that purchase

thought maybeYeah, yeah.That\\'s very true.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, it does.\", \"It really does.\", \"I Can\\'t it doesn\\'t make what you\\'re saying makes sense.\", \"But it doesn\\'t make sense to introduce safety or either side of the point.Yeah.Yeah, I don\\'t see a link, but I know what I feel and what I feel is that impending doom, if you will.I need it in your scenario.\", \"Okay.what I would normally do or what II would panic.\", \"I mean not panic, like break down or something, but I mean it would be very, very stressful if I absolutely had to get that item.\", \"Um, I would probably try to scrape change out of my car, but I know we\\'re not going there now.\", \"Yeah, no stay there.\", \"But um, I would be very, very difficult.I\\'m physically capable of doing it.\", \"Okay.I could do it, I could do it.\", \"I could get through it.It will fade off?\", \"I think.\", \"I mean, it would have to, I would imagine, so it would fade.\", \"I think it would take a longer period of time to fade than if I had just gotten even now seeing here, but even if I had just gotten another item, okay, the world is going to be safe for another five minutes.\", \"We\\'re good.\", \"How much you\\'re feeling right now?\", \"very anxious, right?\", \"Yeah.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.Yes, it\\'s bearable, it\\'s bearable,  Yeah, it\\'s hurt me feel bad.your scenario of having to having to get only one item or having only having the resources for one item andI know it\\'s terrifying.\", \"This this this skin for you.Yeah.Okay.Yes.\", \"coffee, coffee.Yes, so I\\'ll get something.\", \"To buy one coffee?\", \"In scenario two,I would have a lot more anxiety.\", \"But I would really have to talk myself through that.I believe it was the anxiety, I believe.Yes, yeah.Oh, yeah.\", \"No, not at all.Exactly.I would hope that it would be less anxiety.\", \"Could be, could beIt could be I would get old.\", \"I think the anxiety would get exhausted.wouldn\\'t have to walk through the coal to the store, right or to the, the door of theThat would be much easier.\", \"Okay.Okay.\", \"I feel more confident about that.We\\'ll see when we actually get there, but yes, I would like to.\", \"I feel like I could actually try that.\", \"More so than the coffee.\", \"SoYes.I feel better than I don\\'t have to just buy one cup of coffee.But I feel it\\'s it\\'s miles.\", \"But but okay.\", \"But it was.And because I think like the insight that you gave me on, I hadn\\'t connected the safety security, I hadn\\'t connected all the dots.\", \"So that was very helpful.Yeah, gotcha.\", \"Yeah.yeah.\", \"The longer term picture Yeah.I like that a lot.Yeah.Yeah, I do.\", \"It\\'s been a long time.\", \"But I that I mean, the behaviors and the thought processes have been in place for a long time.\", \"So I think it\\'ll be a challenge but i think you know, it\\'s timeI like that one.\", \"Yeah.Oh, yeah, you do?\", \"need to do that.\",

will be easy to remember.\", \"And I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something.I think you know, sitting now, sitting here now I believe them in the moment

\"Yeah.\", \"It\\'s easy.\", \"I realize it\\'s easy to form these plans.\", \"Right.I don\\'t think so I think it makes sense.\", \"Yeah.And I think you know, what you kind of suggested before, like, maybe practicing my deep breathing.\", \"Like maybe now, like when I\\'m calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like, I\\'m more apt to also remember it, then.rightThank you.Okay.\",

driving to work.I was I was in an accident at the end of last year, and, you know, I didn\\'t get hurt.\", \"There was no real damage to the car that I that I noticed.\", \"I just went on about my business I you know, didn\\'t have any issues after the accident.\", \"And now all of a sudden, I\\'m Thinking about this car accident again.\", \"And I don\\'t know where it\\'s coming from.Yeah, umThat\\'s right.\", \"Yeah, probably around Halloween or so.\", \"I would say at least a month ago, maybe six weeks.Every morning I get up I\\'m just really nervous about going to work and you know, have come out to get in the car and sometimes I can barely get in just thinking about been in a car accident again.I\\'m late almost every dayYeah, I even called out a couple times because I was just paralyzed.Well yeah, I live in a house with multiple cars.\", \"So I tried driving my mom\\'s car one day and you know, I have the same feelings.\", \"And initially I thought it was just my car because I did notice some damage to the back of the car.\", \"I was in the bag and I was going through the trunk one day and I saw that the the core was actually pushed in.\", \"I didn\\'t think there was any real damage and I noticed damage to the back of the car.\", \"And I was like, wow, you know, I have been seriously hurt in this accident.\", \"And that\\'s when I started having these feelings like I just started thinking about how bad the accident could have been.\", \"So, you asked if I tried to do anything different.\", \"I tried driving my mom\\'s car.\", \"I tried driving my dad\\'s car, but it seems to be just driving any car, having all this anxiety.physical while I do a lot of like, swelling in my chest, like really panicky.No, not really.No nothing like that.\", \"Oh, yeah, I remember it pretty well.\", \"I was waiting at a stop sign and I think the person behind me they must not have been paying attention but they rear ended meNobody really.\", \"I mean, it was it was an accident.\", \"There was no real damage.\", \"You know, accidents happen all the time, just a fender bender.I\\'ve been really down since I\\'ve been since I started having theseI would say more down

reckless?yeah have been a little a little on edge things have been like scaring me the phone ring in people knocking at the door dogs barking is kind of hit me on edge a little bit.Yeah, yeah, that\\'s kind of worries me a little bit that\\'s running.\", \"Nogood in that area.No trouble falling asleep, but I have had trouble staying asleep.\", \"I\\'ve been waking up pretty much around the clock throughout the night.Not really just maybe like thinking about going to work in the morning.\", \"But no, nothing, nothing major.No.noNo.No, nothing like that.\", \"Thank you for seeing me.\",

for a period Hmm.Um, yeah, sometimes I\\'ll, I\\'ll have a drink.\", \"And I just feel like I want to get into it.Like a beer or two.NoNo, no.Like Do on Fridays after work, you know, after a long week, that\\'s kind of when I really crave it.\", \"Like, go have a drink with some friends.\", \"I\\'ll have a drink sometimes with dinner.\", \"If I\\'m at a social event, kind of feel like I want to have a drink, and I don\\'t really want to feel that way.\", \"I feel like that might be a problem.Yeah.Um, well, I mean, usually I\\'m, I\\'m able to limit my days if I say I\\'ll just going to go to a party this weekend.\", \"I\\'ll have one and then Yeah, usually I can stick to it, too, I guess.Um, no, I, I guess not.\", \"I\\'ve I mean, I think about where I want to have a craving I think about like, when I want to have it, but I don\\'t really spend a lot of time thinking about it or trying to get it.Well.\", \"No, I guess not.\", \"I mean, I get really friendly when I have a drink.\", \"So I don\\'t really think that\\'s a problem.\", \"But you know, I guess not.Yeah.Because of the drinking, no.Well, no.No.\", \"I wouldn\\'t say worse.\", \"No.No.No.I usually feel the same.What do you mean by withdrawal?No.Okay, thank you very much.Yeah.\", \"Well, I mean, I\\'ve been drinking a lot more than usual, but it\\'s kind of just part of my life.\", \"But I don\\'t know, I think there is an increase.\", \"So it\\'s, that\\'s worrying me a little bit.I\\'m gonna go out with my friends a couple nights a week.\", \"Then about once or so we go out with my co workers.\", \"So yeah, maybe three, four nights a week,YeahUm, you know, kind of depends on who I\\'m with.\", \"But usually when I go out my friends on the weekend, I\\'ll stay for a pretty long time.\", \"I mean, I think the problem is when we\\'re going out during the week with my co workers, you know, I\\'ll stay longer than I want to, and then when I have to get up in the morning, it\\'s kind of like I should have gone check out a little earlier, but now they\\'re all out with me.\", \"So when I get there, they understand.Each night we approximately I used to drink, like, maybe two beers an hour, but they really like to party so and I was trying to keep up with him.\", \"So, friends, yeah.\", \"And so I\\'ve been drinking like a shot with the beers I have.\", \"So maybe like three or four drinks an hour.Um, yeah, you know, everyone else is getting to that level.\", \"So I feel like I need to keep up with them.\", \"And usually before I would get that from maybe one or two drinks.\", \"So now, I\\'ve been working a little bit more, I think,to get there.\", \"You know, at the beginning of the week, I\\'ll kind of say I\\'m only going to go out twice this week.\", \"But then they invite me and I\\'m like, Well, I don\\'t want to miss out or my, my friends, you know, it\\'s my show my social time during the week, so so I usually go, they don\\'t really stick to the plan.\", \"So that\\'s kind of been a little frustrating, but I know it\\'s still good.Um, I think I could probably be doing better things with my time, but it\\'s not a huge problem.\", \"I think a lot of people do it.\", \"So you know.Yeah, yeah.\", \"I would say like, one of the work just Ready to get finished so I can go go to happy hour with my co workers or, you know, from just kind of at a barbecue or something with family.\", \"Think about how I want to be here.\", \"So yeah, great things, but no, everyone kind of does that.\", \"Like I could go for a beer right now.Yeah, yeah, yeah.\", \"Yeah.No, my work life has been pretty going pretty well.\", \"I haven\\'t missed work because of it or anything like that.\", \"So because of the drinking.No, I think my social life is actually great because of it.\", \"You know, hang out with my friends and you\\'ll get along really well.\", \"So that\\'s my social time.Yeah, no problems.activities?\", \"Well, usually the important activities involve drinking so that I haven\\'t given up important activities that don\\'t involve drinking.\", \"But that\\'s been pretty easy because there\\'s usually alcohol at that point.\", \"Because I\\'m also involved now and I\\'m usually pretty safe.\", \"Yeah.\", \"SoUm, well, like when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with I think, maybe ADHD or something like that, but I think I teachers were annoyed by me because I was just like, damn good time.\", \"So but that\\'s why Got an issue latelyUm No, I started drinking after that so not now it\\'s not become an issue with that.No, not with my drinking or anything you know, typical teenage smoking marijuana and stuff when I was younger, but I don\\'t anymore so.Yeah, just alcohol.No.\", \"usually feel fine afterwards.\", \"I can go a few days without okay.Yeah, let\\'s see why it would hurt anything.\", \"I don\\'t really need it but it was okay with trauma,Yeah.\", \"Thank you.but they\\'ve been going better.\", \"Yeah, they have good I did call a friend.\", \"And we had lunch.\", \"I\\'d seen this guy in two or three years and it was good to see him when we contacted again and agreed we maybe have lunch.\", \"From time to time, that\\'d be good.\", \"And I got back in the kitchen, I made this pretty good soup.\", \"It\\'s an asparagus potato soup that sounds very it\\'s it\\'s really good to chop up the asparagus and the potatoes and one small onion and boil them and then use a blender to give it a real nice texture, texture a little bit like split pea soup, sounds good without a split pea and so on.\", \"feeling some better.\", \"Well, that\\'s still a mess.\", \"Okay, in fact, it\\'s a it\\'s a it\\'s it\\'s a big mess.\", \"It\\'s such a mess that I really can\\'t get in there and do any work.\", \"I haven\\'t done that for some time.\", \"Okay.\", \"Every surface every why we got to work benches andWell, when I stand there in it, and I feel helpless, I mean it.\", \"It\\'s hopeless, it seems to me that okay, just get it back in shape again.Well, just the mess that it is.\", \"I mean, that how disorganized andhopeless, okay, I think justWell, if I could get one workbench cleaned off, okay, I would have some space to work on.Well, I could make some things that I\\'ve been thinking about making for some time.\", \"Okay, I kind of have the plans in my head.\", \"Okay.\", \"I\\'ve thought about a medieval, kind of small medieval catapult for my grandson.\", \"And maybe Boomerang made out of really nice laminated wood, that would be cool.\", \"And so I could get one or both of those built, perhaps.Well, if I if I built those, I would have to get in the car and drive for hours today.\", \"Okay, my grandkids where my grandkids are and to give them the, the toys, okay, and show them how it works and have shown how to throw the boomerang.Yeah, that Yeah, one.Though.Sure.\", \"Okay, How are you?They think I have a drinking problem.\", \"My family..Yeah.\", \"So we really started this was this past weekend.\", \"They came to pick me up for my bridal shower.\", \"And I was I was drunk when they came to get me so I couldn\\'t go and now everybody\\'s pretty pissed at me.Yeah, you know, I don\\'t want them to hate me or anything.\", \"So I agreed to come.I mean, I like to drink.Yeah.\", \"I like I like it like drinking.that\\'s fine.Pretty much every day.\", \"I drink every day on the weekends for sure.\", \"Like, during the week, I\\'ll go to the whatever the best local happy hour is, you know, scope out what\\'s going on.\", \"So I\\'ll go after work and have some drinks.weekend I gotta keep to myself.\", \"still drink a little whatever I have in the house, but I don\\'t really go out a lot of weekend mostly to stay at home and yeah, drink whatever I have there.it\\'s hard to keep track of thing.\", \"Say a couple cases over maybe like two or three cases of beer throughout the weekend.\", \"If there\\'s something on sale, you know, at the liquor store down the street, okay, I like a bottle of vodka or something to go along with it.during the week, I just stayed at the bar for a few hours maybe have like, six or seven drinks and then go home.Um, I guess so.\", \"I mean, I\\'ve kind of tried to make a plan to just say on the weekends to drink some.\", \"And that hasn\\'t really kept up because I like to go to the happy hours and stuff.yeah, it\\'s not really happening.\", \"Not really see it happening.Um, you could say so yeah.\", \"I\\'m at work I want to drink and out doing stuff.\", \"I want to drink.Right now just alcohol and all legal stuff .\", \"I was impatient.\", \"A couple times for cocaine, but I\\'ve stopped.\", \"That\\'s not really something I want to do anymore.\", \"SoAbout four months ago, five months ago,Yeah.\", \"I was usingWell, I graduated from college, I was kind of a partier in college, and then I had to get a job and it\\'s kind of now had a fear of losing my job because of the cocaine and I\\'d get a drug test and stuff.\", \"So that\\'s kind of in the back of my mind with that.\", \"So yeah.\", \"I think that the treatment helped with that.No, mostly just alcohol.\", \"JustUm, I think I\\'m not doing tip top of what I could be doing but yeah, it hasn\\'t really been a problem.\", \"I haven\\'t been threatened to be fired or anything like that.\", \"But you know, I\\'ll come in late every once in a while but I I sneak in so nobody noticesUm, with my family kind of right now.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Not really getting along with them very well.\", \"My friends, though, when I go out them during the week where you get along fine, but they\\'re just not really as fun as they used to be.\", \"So sometimes, yeah.\", \"Sometimes they want to do stuff and go to the movies or whatever.\", \"And the ello mad because I don\\'t want to go I\\'d rather go party somewhere.\", \"Somore with my family.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I mean, I guess my friends aren\\'t that happy with me but I don\\'t think it\\'s a huge deal.\", \"My best friend I haven\\'t talked to in a couple days because she she is mad at me for not coming to dinner with her the other night because I look rather drunk and I want to do that.\", \"Um I\\'ve gotten hurt a couple times.\", \"I mean, fallen down the steps, but I\\'m not calling like, skydiving or anything, you know?\", \"So I did sprained my ankle a couple months ago because I fell on the steps but Okay.It\\'s a pretty healthy.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"Oh, yeah.\", \"I think I kind of go through phases with it, you know, I\\'ll drink a certain amount for a little while and then I\\'ll notice the I\\'m not drunk anymore, so I\\'ll have to drink some more.Let\\'s say like, last weekend, you know, I was Got a couple beers in my house and the few hours have passed and I drank probably like, and 12 beers and I wasn\\'t feeling anything.\", \"So start drinking a little faster and let us start, you know, feel a little better.I mean, I want some more.\", \"For sure.\", \"cravingI think that\\'s what my mom really wants.\", \"So, so maybe they\\'ll try it out once or twice and see what happens but I guess to make her happy.Yeah, sure.Im hereSo I\\'ve been made to come in and talk to you.\", \"because something happened on the bus.\", \"And there I may have said something to somebody and they\\'re just like, oh, you can\\'t say that.\", \"So they actually said, we\\'re going to take you to jail.\", \"from jail.\", \"They just called me here.They didn\\'t explain anything.\", \"The government never explains anything.\", \"They just don\\'t want me to understand what\\'s going on because they just want to keep me out of captivity.nope, it\\'s the entire government, entire government, higher government.all my life.\", \"I\\'ve done this all my life.\", \"They they\\'re always listening.\", \"They\\'re always around.\", \"They\\'re always there.always there.\", \"Like, for example, they\\'re in the lights right now.\", \"They\\'re listening to everything that we\\'re talking about.\", \"So that\\'s the reason why I really can\\'t talk about what happened on the bus because they\\'re just going to use that against and then it\\'s locked me up again.\", \"I think we take more minutes.Yes, I take the medication, because if I don\\'t take the medication, government comes and takes me away and puts me into a hospital where they force me the medication.\", \"And then the lights are always on and they can always hear everything that I\\'m saying and what I\\'m thinking and what I\\'m going to do.wanting us to take over the world, to take over the world, people in the world, of course, they want to use everything and use everything that everybody knows to use it against them so that they can actually have the world they want in that baby and make everybody pretend that they don\\'t know what\\'s going on.\", \"So therefore, they\\'re using everybody\\'s thoughts against themselves, so that the government can use it to their benefit.No.\", \"So when I\\'m home, I think I\\'m perfectly fine because I set up my house in my room to actually make it government proof so that nobody can actually hear see what\\'s going on in there.\", \"So when I\\'m home, I\\'m perfectly fine.being home and being home I\\'ve saved my mom saved my brother\\'s save everybody safe.\", \"And being out in the world in the world.\", \"That\\'s a nobody safe.No, I told you they are employed, and they can hear everything that we\\'re saying right now.\", \"So no, we\\'re not safe here.at home and safe in my room, that I mean government.I would stay home all the time, but I can\\'t stay home because I mean to go and see doctors and talk to people and do the things that the government needs me or wants me to do.\", \"But I don\\'t want to do those things because she\\'s in my thoughts and they\\'re trying to use everybody and get sleep.\", \"I can\\'t deal with that.Everybody knows that they\\'re in the light.\", \"It\\'s common knowledge.\", \"It\\'s common knowledge.\", \"Everybody knows that.No, of course, everybody hears the lights talking to you.\", \"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\", \"Like everybody hears it.\", \"Sometimes it\\'s a whisper.\", \"For some people.\", \"Sometimes it\\'s a yell.\", \"And if you want to not pay attention to what the lights are saying to you, then I don\\'t know what\\'s

access to the chart room.Can I get a copy of your notes after you\\'re done?Yes, because I might trust you.\", \"And I don\\'t know if I do yet.\", \"But I don\\'t trust the other people who work here

to make me do what they want me to do anyway.\", \"So it doesn\\'t matter how I feel.No, because I\\'ve learned my lesson to not say those things out loud into to talk about what the government\\'s doing because I can\\'t actually inform anybody else because nobody\\'s listening to me because They\\'re already controlled by the government because they don\\'t have a room like I do at home.While people don\\'t understand what\\'s going on, then that\\'s their fault.\", \"that\\'s their problem.\", \"They should have listened to me.\", \"And I could actually gave them the technology that they

the exchange semester itself.\", \"Because I need to take some extra subjects and that means I need to take an extra semester too.\", \"So the biggest possibilityis that I\\'m going to be left behind from all of my peers.\", \"So, that kind of make me anxious and yeah, I\\'m kind of butterflies at the back.Well, yeah, oh, the first one is because that I\\'m not ready yet to be left with all my friends, and then also because if I need to take an extra semester then it also means that I need to pay an extra tuition for the semester, right?Well, no, my parents paid for me.Yeah.\", \"And

noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious.\", \"And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed.Yeah.That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my caseI would say like a 70.So I\\'m in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out.\", \"I really don\\'t want to so I\\'m thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it.\", \"But I know the dog keeps barking,

snoring?I think is probably closer to three now feeling more hopeful and kind of not feeling I guess maybe feeling like it\\'s a little bit less of a big deal than I felt like when I came init comes and goes,Yeah, yeah.Yeah, I think that\\'ll be good because then also in the morning, I\\'ll remember it\\'s the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this.Okay.\", \"What should I do with it?\", \"Should I like write it on a sticky note and get rid of it?\", \"Should I keep it in a journal or?No, I mean, I think it was really helpful.\", \"I just had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, just write it down and everything.\", \"I can do that.Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I\\'ve worked a lot to help other people.\", \"So I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well.\", \"And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it.Okay.\", \"Thank you.I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn\\'t like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I have all my friends were doing it and it was just it\\'s it\\'s not something that I like do okay on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it\\'s nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes.I get what you\\'re coming from but I I really did.\", \"I thought that I had it under control.\", \"And I didn\\'t let myself get too far gone.\", \"I didn\\'t want to be in how do I put this little Like, I want it to be in control.\", \"And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, so I didn\\'t let myself drink too much.Yeah, I understand exactly what you\\'re saying.\", \"AndI don\\'t think I\\'m drinking that much.\", \"I mean, it\\'s, it\\'s mainly for social gatherings.\", \"Like it\\'s nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever.\", \"It\\'s just theevery other weekend, I would sayI guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you\\'re coming from.Yeah, I guess I haven\\'t really put it on myself, I guess it\\'s really been forced on their account.\", \"And I\\'ve just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they\\'re doing is a lot of fun.\", \"And I just want to make sure that I\\'m getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.Yeah, I, I do see that.\", \"Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense.\", \"And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking.Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it\\'s just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely.\", \"I don\\'t I don\\'t really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.Yeah, I, I just I don\\'t see the problem in it right now.\", \"And maybe it\\'s because I haven\\'t really had that traumatic event experience.\", \"But, ummYou\\'re right.\", \"I don\\'t want I don\\'t want to be too far gone.\", \"Before it\\'s too late.\", \"Like I I can imagine something possibly happening where it\\'s to a degree where I can\\'t escape.\", \"And I I guess I\\'ve never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much are affected anybody close to me that much.\", \"So I guess it\\'s something that I feel like I\\'m in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.\", \"Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into and life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.Okay.\", \"Oh, actually could I can find something new.\", \"That doesn\\'t bother me lately.\", \"Well, prior to that party, like as you know, I\\'m an honor student and my parents like they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I\\'m always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party.\", \"And on.\", \"Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend\\'s house.\", \"HmmSo I, that\\'s when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don\\'t know, It was fun, at least in that moment.\", \"So I kept doing it.\", \"Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing.\", \"She asked me to like to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I\\'ll pick you up by 12.\", \"Our surprise is told us basically when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I\\'ll, I\\'ll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.\", \"So later, so she promised that she dropped me off.\", \"I promised her no alcohol, no nothing.\", \"So we go out Have fun like I\\'ve, I\\'ve been having, and I was drinking.\", \"And then it\\'s time, the time came for her to pick me up.\", \"And as soon as I couldn\\'t delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka.\", \"And I\\'m like, I didn\\'t know what to say.\", \"I just looked at the floor, and I feel terrible.\", \"Because I betrayed my mother.\", \"I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol.\", \"And that\\'s exactly what I did.right.\", \"Like I\\'ve been noticing I\\'ve been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.Really, I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I\\'m caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff like that.\", \"I don\\'t know it.\", \"It\\'s because I\\'m a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I\\'m doing sports, but like, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself.\", \"Because I\\'m very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me I\\'m able to talk or engage with other people more easily.\", \"And it\\'s just.Exactly.Just different group friends of group girlfriends, like the different people that I\\'m hanging out.\", \"Not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene.\", \"So that that\\'s also changed.a little bit because not all of them are into that.\", \"So like, I\\'m in one group of friends and I will talk to another person within another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.\", \"So since then, I\\'ve been hanging out more with them getting to know them.\", \"But I could also see that on just living life, I guess.\", \"But that\\'s also not fair to them that I\\'m not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Oh, I should I should stop.\", \"I mean, like, I\\'m not, not unrealistic.\", \"I understand that.\", \"situations like this will happen.\", \"It\\'s just up to me not to take it so far where I can\\'t remember the night before.\", \"If I\\'m puking, all I remember is a toilet.\", \"That\\'s, that\\'s not worth it either.\", \"And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that\\'s a big blow as little or, like as it may seem to the other people like to me that it\\'s a big thing.\", \"of course, I\\'m pretty confidentprobably like an eight or nine I\\'m I can\\'t be in time because nothing\\'s attend my field.\", \"There\\'s too many factors but I feel like I\\'m determined toBecause I don\\'t know I feel determined to to make sure this happens because I don\\'t like how I felt after I betrayed my mother.\", \"I don\\'t like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.It\\'s not a pleasant experience.\", \"It\\'s not something that I wish to enjoy.\", \"So like, even if I do drink, I don\\'t want to drink to the point where that happens.\", \"Like all the fun that I have, then prior to that, just it\\'s not worth it\\'s not worth drinking.To make sure I have my studies?\", \"Well, first, try to get back my trust with my mother.Then just focus on my studies.\", \"Then if I have time for leisure time, like I\\'ll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn\\'t mean I have to drink and I do.\", \"One cup is not gonna do anything to my life either.\", \"But I\\'d prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure Exactly.\", \"Just so I take part with the social convention, but it\\'s not.\", \"Hey, guys.\", \"It\\'s about doing the Yeah.And thank you for listening and listening to me.\", \"All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend.\", \"Usually, as you know, I\\'m an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to.\", \"And when I when I got there, like, I\\'m not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason.\", \"And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing.\", \"So I wouldn\\'t be I wouldn\\'t be ostracized.\", \"I know that.\", \"It\\'s bad for me.\", \"It\\'s bad for my body is bad for for, for for being on the team for being an athlete.\", \"it hinders my performance.\", \"Just I don\\'t know, I feel that my friends pressured me.\", \"I don\\'t know if I should, like, go with different friend groups.\", \"Maybe I don\\'t know.I don\\'t know.\", \"Like, being in a sports team.\", \"You feel very, you have to, like, be unified with the group.Right and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be expected To lead not only in the sports but also in social environments.\", \"And if that\\'s social, so social custom in our society, soI could, but that could also backfire on me.\", \"I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having the stick up my blood.\", \"You know,I mean, it\\'s just one.\", \"I\\'m just one person.\", \"Well, supermom.Okay.\", \"Well, I\\'ll dedicate the time not to party and like, no, not not not party, but you get involved with alcohol to that extent.\", \"And, like have it publicized on the internet.\", \"Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet?\", \"Like, I will avoid situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so others can see.I\\'ll stop.I promise.Okay.Yeah.Okay.today?\", \"Today is 15Aaah 15thJuneIt\\'s Thursday.It\\'s hot.\", \"It\\'s summer.No.Hard floor is hard.New York ?New CastlePennsylvania ?Well, flower,

yeah.Uhh Not really.Yeah.You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job.\", \"So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that.\", \"So,Yeah, I mean, obviously, that\\'s, you know, you have a job.\", \"So you can take care of certain things.\", \"So, yeah, like you know like paying your bills and that\\'s pretty much it.\", \"I guess that\\'s really why most people have a job.Yeah, yeah, definitely.I mean, what can I say I lost my job.\", \"I\\'m seeing you because I have a drinking problem.\", \"So things are not that great.No.I drink a lot.I always say to myself that I\\'ll try to drink less but at this point, it\\'s kind of like what have I got to lose?\", \"You knowYeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now sohmmmI don\\'t know.At this point, it\\'s kind of like who cares?\", \"Like what difference does it really make, you knowYeah.Nothing really feels good.\", \"Yeah, pretty muchthis morningA lot, I don\\'t know.NoI mean, at a certain point, it\\'s like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink.\", \"Like to get through the day.\", \"So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don\\'t really know how much that is.\", \"Like, I don\\'t sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning.\", \"I don\\'t I don\\'t know.\", \"Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better.\", \"I keep some alcohol by my bed because it\\'s hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it\\'s just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink.\", \"So I\\'ll drink some then.\", \"You know, and just to function, so I don\\'t know how much I don\\'t knowYeah.I\\'m pretty indifferent.\", \"Like I said, I mean, I just don\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t.\", \"At this point.\", \"It\\'s like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont knowI guess I just don\\'t know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that\\'s not what I meant.That I mean, I don\\'t know if that\\'s what\\'s causing me problems.\", \"But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I\\'m saying.I would like to not, I would like to be happy.\", \"I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life.\", \"But at this point, I\\'d rather just I don\\'t know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it?\", \"What is the point?\", \"Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I\\'m gonna lose my house?\", \"And you know, I just don\\'t get it.\", \"Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working?\", \"It\\'s not working.\", \"And so I\\'m just supposed to like keep trying.\", \"I don\\'t get that anymore.\", \"I don\\'t get it.Yeah, I mean, yeah.\", \"As it is like, this just doesn\\'t make any sense to me.\", \"Like why should I keep fighting to be sober.\", \"If I can\\'t, you know, I lost my job.\", \"It\\'s too late for that.\", \"Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse.\", \"I\\'m not saying it\\'s your fault.\", \"I\\'m just saying like, what\\'s the point of this?\", \"If it\\'s not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn\\'t be able to handle it.I don\\'t knowsitting at home drinking  hmm, that\\'s about it.\", \"Not drinking anything else going liquor store that\\'s about it.\", \"I mean, seriously, it\\'s just funny like, I don\\'t even there is nothingNo, not really.\", \"I mean, I\\'m going to lose my house so I\\'m just biding my time until that happens.\", \"I don\\'t really

remember cuz sometimes is a long time ago but more recently like maybe once or twice at least.Yeah.Yeah.Well, there was that time that I tried to commit suicide and then there have been times before that where I like, you know, kind of like tested the waters like, you know, just cut myself a little bit to see what it would be like and that kind of thing.Um, it would be the last time I tried to commit suicide like that with time I was telling you about that really freaked me out.\", \"So I don\\'t think I would try that again.No  Not like cutting myself up.I don\\'t know.Yeah.Yeah.No, I don\\'t wanna live like that I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I guess it\\'s really sad like, nobody wants that.\", \"You know, whenever you hear somebody committed suicide, everybody\\'s really sad about

do.\", \"So I mean, I\\'m sure.\", \"Like, it\\'s not a great thing, but at the same time, I don\\'t know.YeahUm, I don\\'t know.\", \"Like, I guess not really.\", \"Because there have been times when

you know, I\\'ve already asked her, you know, if anything were to happen to me, you know, just in general, if she would take the cat, you know,Kind of like, two months ago,No, I guess not.\", \"I mean, I don\\'t know.\", \"Like I just asked her in general like if anything happened to me.\", \"SoI don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I lost my job.\", \"I I live alone.\", \"I don\\'t know, like, I\\'m gonna have to, like move out and I don\\'t even know where I\\'m going to go.Yes.I just You mean like what kind of job did I do ?I worked at a gas station.I liked it.\", \"You know we had some regular customers and kind of get to know them its a little.\", \"I don\\'t know.\", \"You just you know that my coworkers are nice.\", \"And you know, we have not like great benefits, but there was some stuff you know, you could get like couple vacation days and stuff.\", \"SoI just don\\'t see how I would.I mean, I lost this job.\", \"So why would I be good enough to get another job?I went to work

a number of years.\", \"So kept itunder control, really, but uhyeah, so that was four years ago.\", \"So yeah, it was quite disappointing to, to go through all again.\", \"But it\\'s sort of started at the, towards the end of university.\", \"So staying low, and close on course, for first I know she\\'s coming up to my final exams, and a lot of us as a few exams.\", \"And so I just started working really hard.\", \"I felt like right now is the real time to put the effort in and to put the work in.\", \"So I started to step a bit later and take on a bit more work.\", \"So my stress levels sort of start to increase over a while.\", \"I was drinking a lot more coffee took few caffeine tablets and energy drinks.\", \"A few people were because some of the environment at the time was a lot of people were pushing themselves that they wouldn\\'t normally do and some people were taking Ritalin.Yeah.Yeah.\", \"Because it was just like it was that was necessary at the time.\", \"AndWell, I it\\'s sort of increased my confidence at the time.\", \"everything that was going on, I was becoming a lot more productive and a lot more competent a lot, was working harder, my brain was working faster.\", \"And so I mmmmm momentum was building up and up throughout the period.\", \"Yeah, and so I was I was relishing it I was doing a lot work andYeah, well, for me it was.\", \"It was my sort of time.\", \"So I spent I spent three years I thought  I was in control I was doing well.\", \"I didn\\'t wasn\\'t really part of my life at the time.\", \"I didn\\'t really talk to any of my friends about it.\", \"But then I yeah, I started to just sort of grow into it.\", \"And I took the opportunity to Yeah, enjoy this time and it\\'s so it didn\\'t really reach its peak until after my exams I was still.\", \"I was still functioning throughout my exams, and I have since found out that I didn\\'t get the results that I wanted to.Well, I thought that I was working harder than ever, but it was misjudged, I think and so I, I didn\\'t perform to the best of my ability in when it came to the to the exams, and so I didn\\'t achieve.\", \"I didn\\'t achieve a first time and I only got to one.well, so to the end of the end of university, and that was the time where all as soon as that period stopped of work then I was sort of let off the leash a bit.\", \"And yeah, I just thought to grow even further.\", \"So I mentioned I was I was taking Ritalin to block coffee and as soon as our exams had stopped, I just substance abuse of took a bit more of a hold.\", \"And yeah, I just sort of grew into this person who I thought was him was the guy that everyone wanted to be around and to see and so I made sure that I was just everywhere that could be seen I was.yeah.\", \"So we will just scan out a lot, but if not every night YeahYeah.\", \"So developed into cocaine.\", \"A lot.\", \"Okay.\", \"And the Ameri and car.I honestly was on cloud nine at the time.\", \"And yeah, I was just always the person ever wanted.\", \"Everyone wanted to know.\", \"In my head.\", \"I was like, I put myself at the center of the universe and I even I convinced a friend of mine who develops apps that we should if I had an idea to develop an app about when you go into a alcohol shop that it all the way up put out what\\'s the most cost effective way to get wasted?\", \"So yeah, I mean, I, at the time I was spending a lot of money, a lot of my parents savings, I got a credit card, which I didn\\'t tell them about.\", \"And so in this sort of role as the man as the man about town I was spent a lot on Yeah, I\\'ll hold drugs close invested in this technology and I wasWell, having not had to deal with my illness throughout University and for it not being a part of that world, I I didn\\'t confront those symptoms in a in a way that\\'s gonna have long term stability.\", \"And as well, it began with doing the work that I needed to do.\", \"That\\'s just, that\\'s just what I needed to do in order to achieve my goals and to achieve what I want to.\", \"And then it just, I just let it take hold.\", \"And I it was all part of it wasn\\'t it wasn\\'t Yeah, it wasn\\'t the illness It was me it was just I was in, I was the master of this whole situation and I was everything that was happening was down to my own doing.It just it was my time.\", \"It all been leading to like, this was the moment where I would sort of like, become the person that I want it to be.\", \"all the hard work, all everything while the work that my parents had done for me and all the work that I had been doing.\", \"It was now crystallizingThey saw it gradually diminished.\", \"I think it began at six, five.\", \"And was ended up about three and two.Think the harder I was working, the faster my brain then will work and how much the harder I work, the more I would do.\", \"So it was it wasn\\'t.\", \"It was just a Yeah, the momentum was building more than anything.\", \"My thoughts were firing and my goals was stronger in my Yeah, my determination wasNo, I couldn\\'t recall the time maybe I was trying to get my way I was avoiding avoiding confronting any negative effects but nothing powerful comes on.\", \"There was I hide a lot of savings.\", \"That my my parents had built up for me, which I probabiliy don\\'t really exist anymore either through the money invested, and through drugs, clothes.\", \"I had a girlfriend at the time but because it was because I was the main character, and in a sense, it always was only the only person that matters and so sort of those around me especially, still didn\\'t really have as much importance.\", \"So on nights out, I wouldn\\'t.\", \"She just wouldn\\'t be in my mind and so that would be Other women.\", \"soI think it\\'s, it\\'s those moments where it\\'s not just me.\", \"It\\'s those those closest to you and those around you that have to suffer the more than anyone else that brings a lot of the shameYep.TuesdayWhere I usually always am at school.\", \"I was on my Walker.\", \"That\\'s stupid girl.Melanie was talking about Tim my Tim.\", \"My boyfriend and I know it was it was my Tim she was talking about I just wanted to punch her so bad.Yeah, she was talking about him.\", \"And he had he didn\\'t text me the night before.\", \"So who knows what\\'s going on?\", \"so angry.\", \"so angrylike a nineYeah.The next thing I did, I slammed my locker.\", \"And I walked down to the gym but what I wanted to do was push her adn punch her.Yeah.I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can\\'t punch her.\", \"I\\'m going to get in trouble.\", \"I\\'m going to go cut.Mm hmm.Well, nobody was there because gym classes are in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym.\", \"So I went behind the bleachers.the pencil that I have always usedYeahYeah.Yeah, I know.\", \"It\\'s just it\\'s it\\'s my favorite pencil.\", \"I, I use it for school.\", \"And I just it\\'s my favorite pencil.\", \"I was still like was still pretty high maybe like an eight and a half though because I I knew I knew I was gonna cutso it like came down a little bitWell I thought a couple things I thought I\\'m glad I kept this pencil and that I\\'m just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly.on my leg.threeNo, I mean, I guess I could have used a band aid but whatever.No.Like a threeThat felt good.\", \"I feel better.\", \"And I\\'m gonna have to talk to Michelle about this.The Feeling better?\", \"Yeah, for the most part.\", \"Yeah, it didMm hmm.Well, I kind of forgot about it.\", \"But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut.\", \"Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you.\", \"And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it\\'s usually a pretty hard time.Yeah.No.\", \"That always seems to happen.Yeah, I guess so.I\\'ve been doing pretty goodYeah, maybe.\", \"I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.Yeah, cuz she\\'s stupid.Yeah.\", \"That\\'s right.OkayIt\\'s not going to bring it down all the way to a three, though.\", \"I\\'ll tell you that much.All rightAll right.Yeah, it is.I mean, Only if I am in the mood to cut it\\'s temptingYeah, I am.Yeah, maybe.I mean, maybe only, only if it\\'s can be like a really cool pencilYeah.Oh, what I do a lot at home when my mom\\'s bothering me and saying stuff I don\\'t want to hear I put my headphones on.Yeah, they they they actually they let me keep them on in school.I think so.\", \"there\\'s a there\\'s a few songs that usually helped me so I think so.Well, I really like my teacher, Mrs.\", \"Xion.\", \"So she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk.\", \"And her rooms kind of right down the hallway from my locker than the same hallway.\", \"So I guess I could talk to her.\", \"I can, but I really want like a cooler pencil though, like, like a cooler pencil, so I don\\'t know, maybe, maybe we could go look for a pencil together.Okay, I\\'d like that.\", \"Yeah.\", \"You\\'re welcome.I\\'m not feeling very well.\", \"I am very sad.\", \"I am.\", \"I\\'m really scared.I want to run away.Coming to the hospitalYes, I know lots of good games.\", \"Okay.I am feeling a bit better.Yes, I can do that.Okay.Um All right.it\\'s about the same.\", \"I\\'m still feeling pretty down.\", \"I mean, I just feel really stuck and not happy and I just don\\'t know why.I mean, I\\'ve been feeling like really isolated lately.\", \"You know, because I\\'m a stay at home mom.\", \"It\\'s hard.\", \"There\\'s not a lot of people.\", \"You know, right at my fingertips to spend my time with, you know, obviously my family but, um, so I guess, you know, I kind of I had some friends in the neighborhood, but like, our friendships just kind of fizzled out.\", \"And I ever since then it\\'s just like, I don\\'t really feel like doing much.\", \"I just kind of feel like what\\'s the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff.\", \"You know, I used to, you know, shop for the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning and I still do that stuff.\", \"But a lot of times, you know, I let it slide.\", \"Sometimes I won\\'t make dinner or whatever.\", \"And when I do do it, I just feel like I\\'m forcing myself to do it.\", \"The passion is gone.For a long time, I have two boys.\", \"They\\'re eight and 10 and I\\'ve been staying home since my first one was born.\", \"So 10 years and you know, it\\'s it\\'s been really rewarding for me I\\'m not really interested in going back to work or anything like that.\", \"Because I know people always say you\\'re, you know, you\\'re feeling unfulfilled, like you should go back to work, but it\\'s not it.\", \"You know, I\\'ve felt happy with it for so long.\", \"I don\\'t think that it\\'s being home.\", \"I think it\\'s some thing inside of me.Yeah, exactly.\", \"Well, I guess, you know, my youngest is eight.\", \"So he\\'s only been in school for a couple of years.\", \"So I guess like, it\\'s not super recent, but recently he, I finally have no children in the home.\", \"So it\\'s more, it\\'s more time to myself.\", \"And I kind of fill that gap a little bit with other things.\", \"Like I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while.\", \"And like I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood so that kind of like, fill that time.\", \"But now that stuff, it\\'s just not really happening anymore.\", \"So now I kind of feel like it\\'s not it\\'s not boredom, you know, it\\'s not like I don\\'t have enough to do.\", \"It\\'s like, I don\\'t want to do anything.\", \"But then at the same time, I feel frustrated because there\\'s nothing to do.Yeah, I think a lot more with myself because I know That I would feel better if I, you know, maybe found more friends or found something to do with my time, but I don\\'t want to at the same time, so I\\'m frustrated with myself because I know I kind of know what would help but then I don\\'t really have the like the volition to do it.Yeah,I\\'m not motivated.\", \"Yeah, I mean, obviously, my husband has noticed because he has to get the boys ready in the morning.\", \"He\\'s really supportive.\", \"I know he can tell that I\\'m not feeling the same.\", \"But you know, he works.\", \"And then he has to come home and pick up my slack.\", \"So he\\'s getting frustrated, which I understand.\", \"And, you know, my mom has said to me that, you know, she thinks I\\'m not doing as much and so it kind of hurts.\", \"It feels like everybody\\'s trying to tell me I\\'m lazy and then I\\'m not doing enough and it\\'s always that like feeling, you know, like nobody really understands how much work that goes into being a mother, but then at the same time now that I\\'m doing less and less, I feel like they\\'re all right.\", \"You know, I am lazy.\", \"I\\'m not doing anythingNo, no, not that I can remember.\", \"I, you know, I think my mom said, like, you\\'re not doing as much as you used to and I kind of took offense to that, even though it\\'s kind of true.\", \"It\\'s like, I don\\'t know.\", \"It hurt.\", \"You know, I think at first we didn\\'t really acknowledge it.\", \"It was like, you know, I took a break here.\", \"He picked up the slack and it was fine, but now that it\\'s been and more he\\'s kind of getting frustrated and, you know, he\\'s been asking me about how I feel and why I\\'m not doing as much but at the same time, like, even though he knows that I\\'m not motivated, it\\'s still frustrating because I, it\\'s my responsibility.\", \"So I think he\\'s, you know, he\\'s been saying, like, I need you to do more around the house pretty much is what he said, I need you to do more.I started crying because I know he\\'s right and that\\'s what I tell myself every day, I need to do more, but I don\\'t have the motivation to do it.\", \"And so I\\'m so frustrated with myself.\", \"And, you know, I know that he needs that from me and I don\\'t know why I\\'m not motivated to do it.YeahHmmYeah.\", \"Yeah, I actually think, you know, I\\'ve been feeling this way more like in the past, like six months or something like that, like I, it was hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in like the natural way that it is hard.\", \"But this is something else this is more consuming.\", \"It\\'s, you know, like the difficulty of him going away to school, almost was motivating, like it was hard, but at the same time, it was freeing because I had other opportunities to do stuff.\", \"This is just like stunting.Sure.\", \"Onn Wednesday, I was having a really hard time getting out of bed.\", \"So my husband just got the kids ready in the morning and I felt really bad about that.\", \"So I just stayed in bed for a couple more hours, probably until like 1030.\", \"And I got up you know, I\\'m made myself something to eat.\", \"And then I thought, you know, I should probably go to the store because we\\'re almost out of milk.\", \"And, you know, and I think the boys need shampoo, but I just, I just sat down and I just sat there and I think I sat for I don\\'t even know how long the boys came home from school.\", \"It was like, you know, 330 and I hadn\\'t even gotten up.\", \"And so then I said, Okay, the boys are home.\", \"I should probably get started on dinner soon, because my husband will be home soon.\", \"And I found I found something in the fridge to make and I made dinner and you know, after that everybody, you know, just sat down, we just watch TV and I just sat there until it was time to go to bed.UmmhuhhI wish that I would wake up and you know, I would want to wake up when it was time for the kids to get ready to school to go to school.\", \"You know, I could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed, I could pay for lunches and get the boys dressed and you know, check they needed any permission slip sign, that kind of thing.\", \"Send them out the door and then I would see if we needed anything from the store.\", \"I probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house.\", \"I used to like have like a list of chores that like I would do different things on different days and different days of the month and stuff.\", \"So like bedding would get washed one day in the week and that kind of thing.\", \"So I would probably like follow that list.\", \"Nowadays I just, you know if it gets done, it gets done and usually my husband helps me with some of the stuff and you know, I would do the bathrooms one day a week that probably gets done like once a month now.\", \"But um, I would do that so do the cleaning.\", \"If we if I needed to go to the story we do that.\", \"I get ready for the boys to come home I\\'d probably make them a snack and and figure out what was going to be for dinner, I would go ahead and do that.\", \"And then probably, you know, sometimes we we would watch TV after my husband got home after dinner or I would figure out something for us to do, we could play a board game or or watch a movie as a family or something like that.\", \"And that would be after the kids did their homework and everything like that.\", \"And then after we spent some time together, I put them in a bed.Right.I just like, you know, the alarm goes off, and I know it\\'s time to get up and my husband\\'s getting out of bed and I just look at the clock and I think, what\\'s the point and, you know, it\\'s just this instant feeling of I can\\'t even describe it like pointlessness of getting up.\", \"And so, I go back to sleep, but I feel worse for doing it.\", \"You know, like, it\\'s a catch 22 like, I don\\'t want to wake up, I just don\\'t want to, but then when I go back to sleep, I feel bad.\", \"I feel guilty.\", \"It just it\\'s just like, you know, when I\\'m sleeping, I don\\'t realize how sad I am.\", \"And I don\\'t realize how hard it is to function.\", \"When I\\'m sleeping.\", \"I\\'m not aware of that as soon as I wake up I am.\", \"And so I just have this feeling of like, what\\'s the point of getting up and experiencing these feelings when I could go back to sleep and not have toYes, yeah.\", \"Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.yeahyeahYeah.Yeah, it was so easy.\", \"I would just like, you know, I would wake up and, and I would be like, Okay, it\\'s time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go.\", \"I mean, you know, sometimes if, if, if I was a little bit tired, it would be a little bit harder.\", \"You know, it\\'s not, you know, as a stay at home mom, I usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kids are older and everything, so it\\'s not usually too hard to get up and I would, I would, you know, it would be another good day, you know, I would be glad to get up and take care of the things that I needed to take care of and I felt accomplished.yeah, I mean, I want everything to be normal again.\", \"And I guess I never really thought of it like that.\", \"Like, I just thought, Well, if I\\'m waking up at the right time, and I\\'m just feeling bad then like, like I said, What\\'s the point, but I guess it makes sense.\", \"Like, even if I don\\'t feel like doing it, maybe it\\'ll make me feel better if I do do it, even if it\\'s hard, because nothing is really harder than when I\\'m already going through.Does that make sense?\", \"And also, I guess I thought that, no, it wouldn\\'t really be that beneficial to get up.\", \"Yeah.Yeah.I mean, I guess I could tell myself like I can do this.\", \"Like Instead of, you know, when I say to myself, what\\'s the point instead I can say, I can do this?\", \"I can get out of it.\", \"It\\'ll be okay.\", \"I can.\", \"I\\'m strong enough, even though it\\'s hard to push through the pain and get up now, even though I don\\'t want to, I can say I can do this.\", \"Yeah, I mean, I know it\\'s valuable.\", \"I guess what my frustration is, is that I know it\\'s valuable and it used to give me like an emotional payoff of like, pride and, and satisfaction and now I\\'m not getting that anymore.\", \"So I guess I need to realize that even though I\\'m not getting it right now.\", \"If I keep trying, maybe it will happen again, because it did happen before,So never get the satisfaction of sending my kids off to school by never send my kids off to school,I never thought about it like that.Yeah, yeah.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.Not letting the negative thoughts take over because that\\'s what I\\'m thinking like, okay, I can get the kids off to school, but after that, I\\'m going to start thinking You know, what\\'s the point again?\", \"Like, what?\", \"Why don\\'t I just sit down, there\\'s just no point.\", \"So if I can keep reminding myself that I just have to try, and that I did accomplish something, and then, you know, even though it\\'s hard, and I know that those thoughts are going to come back, and then I\\'m going to feel bad.\", \"If I don\\'t do anything, I\\'m not going to feel any better.hmmmOkayyeah, I think I can try that.Thank you.Yeah, I just then recently I\\'ve just been feeling down a lot.\", \"And I can\\'t really like snap out of it.\", \"Like sometimes if it\\'s happened before, I can just like, get myself back on track.\", \"But recently, I\\'ve just found it really difficult to do it.\", \"Yeah, yeah, definitely.\", \"and my long term boyfriend broke up with me and it was such a shock like I really wasn\\'t expecting it.\", \"And it\\'s got me really down and felt really lonely and and I didn\\'t really want to see people and she wanted a baby in space and the mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and and he is her family to you.I just nothing\\'s really changed, nothing\\'s really improved.\", \"I feel down like absence and feel distant from things and like I said, I can\\'t stop all over.And I was kind of disappointed in myself, because I feel like maybe else my ages doing this, like, I should have been able to snap out of it.\", \"Like, it\\'s just another thing that I\\'ve not really affects me make me stand out for the wrong reasons.And I\\'m just hoping that it\\'s going to help.\", \"I think I didn\\'t I didn\\'t really want to admit it, because like it\\'s just another failure.\", \"But my mom was talking to me and, and she\\'s, she\\'s not really happy with the way I\\'m behaving and I don\\'t really want to disappoint her again.\", \"And so I thought there\\'s no harm in  thisYeah.Yeah, and not currently in the Unii room and but yeah, last year as a medical student,and I Like he is pretty tall fast as a then suggested I took a year out.\", \"This is the Break.Yeah, was that I thought we still for everyone, but obviously we\\'ll take it in different ways daily.And yeah I am gonna have to really so.\", \"YeahI think return is probably that\\'s what\\'s gonna make everyone happy.\", \"And I think you know, at least I\\'ll be able to finally achieve something and get something right.\", \"So yeah, like next year, I\\'m going to get through it.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I do.\", \"And I do.\", \"Enjoy it, I just I just don\\'t feel like mate the main man and I just, it\\'s a lot of flack and a lot of pressure and but that\\'s what comes with it and, you know, it\\'ll work out for the best if I go.And I\\'ve not really had much on the horizon men more men, have friends owns a restaurant.\", \"And like she suggested that did a better way to sit in there.\", \"Just deliver a bit like money and stuff because I\\'ve seen that in Uni.\", \"So, you know, I\\'ve done that.And I\\'ve only done one so far.\", \"And yeah, I don\\'t know whether it\\'s something that I\\'d probably go back to but It was last week actually.Umm it was, it was different, you know, because it was like I could.\", \"I did enjoy it because there\\'s like, it\\'s just different aspects and I had to like, speak to people and like, try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff.\", \"Like, I wasn\\'t very good.\", \"But I suppose like it was handy to have some money and, like, get out of the house.Yeah.I just I just bit slow and people sometimes they didn\\'t stand by science, so I\\'d have to talk louder or quieter or slower and a bit confused sometimes with the orders.\", \"And then just don\\'t really think that I\\'m not really like a friendly.\", \"Like, people don\\'t really think that I\\'m a friendly person.\", \"They didn\\'t really want to talk to me and stuff.\", \"I felt like I was like inconveniencing them by like, asking them things and getting things wrong.\", \"But yeah, they said they said that apparently and most people got like a few mistakes on the fascia.\", \"But then again, she\\'s my mom\\'s friend so probably why she\\'s saying it.Yeah.Yeah.but and, but it\\'s probably just, she\\'s just trying to make me feel better she probably felt sorry for me because I\\'m obviously not very good at it.\", \"Like, I\\'m not very good for any things recently.\", \"I think she just felt sorry for me.Like, like such as my mother\\'s friends and she\\'s obviously feeling sorry for my mom as well because she\\'s got a daughter it\\'s not like anyone else who harried and she\\'s just like all alone and she\\'s not getting involved so I think she just feel sorry for me and she doesn\\'t want to extend until upset me.\", \"Yeah.I feel empty.\", \"I do.\", \"I\\'m just calling as it is and just call it as reality.\", \"And I feel like I\\'m being honest with myself by just leasing it and not trying to get around tighten it because No, I can see myselfAbout 80I just feel just, like sad.\", \"I\\'m not really myself.\", \"I just like it\\'s like I\\'m not really bad, but when I am coming through Good job, andfeel drained.\", \"They feel like I\\'m in touch with anything And just like everything\\'s going on around me, but I\\'m just not there.\", \"I\\'m just if I can just walk inI didn\\'t know how to describe it.\", \"I got like I have a bit of like we can have any kind of got like butterflies in your nerves and stuff.Yeah, I was pretty nervous then.\", \"But when I got into it, they went away and like, it just talked to me for a bit.\", \"And so obviously, I realized that I wasn\\'t doing a very good job.i am feeling downI feel drained like, then you will have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes, because y\\'ll play less and less than the body\\'s having and I don\\'t want to.I just have to go expose that don\\'t really have a choice because my mom I live with my mom and I know it\\'s hard for her.\", \"So I don\\'t want her to be too worried.\", \"So I just I just tried to carry on as normal girl takes longer and I don\\'t want to but I do.\", \"So now its my routine.Yeah.I\\'m just thinking that nobody else is like mate my age like, maybe we should be feeling like this.\", \"And I\\'m the only one that does.I don\\'t, I don\\'t want to feel like this but i do and nobody else I know doors.\", \"So it makes me feel even more alone gets me even more down.\", \"I just

drag on and, you know, I got along with my co workers and that kind of thing.\", \"So it felt meaningful to me.\", \"meaningful.Yeah, I feel like, you know, doing my job, I got to know people, you know, help people out with things that they needed.\", \"You know, when things were bad I could, you know, get kids out of situations that were really dangerous for them and, you know, no one else was

dangerous.\", \"To be there like to do my job, it feels dangerous.I mean, I guess it\\'s like, quantitatively the same as before.\", \"I do the same things with families.\", \"But now I kind of feel like I can\\'t trust my own judgment like everything.\", \"Before everything just kind of felt a little more black and white, and now it just feels like everything is so much a shade of gray that I just can\\'t tell.\", \"You know what\\'s right and what\\'s wrong anymore.\", \"And every time I feel like I have a good instinct I doubt it I question it I have all these ideas of, well, you know, if I remove the kids from this family, what if they\\'re not really doing the things?\", \"I think they\\'re doing?\", \"Like what if the parents are actually good parents?\", \"What if the kids get put into a home that\\'s bad for them?Yeah, sometimes it was tougher than others, but it just seemed more like I could make a decision and kind of wipe my hands of it and, you know, move on to the next thing.\", \"And now I just feel like there\\'s all these doubts in my head and all these questions about if I\\'m doing the right thing.Yeah, yeah, definitely.\", \"I feel like I\\'m second

was at university when, when I was at university, first one, I was doing medicine and it was an I was trying to get to know this boy, while this boy was trying to get to know me.\", \"And it was, and he was trying to get inside me and, and that\\'s when it all sort of started coming.\", \"I think he wanted to.I was taking my exams when I was going to take my exams, but I didn\\'t take them Because I wasn\\'t very well.\", \"So I came home.Yeah, people, I\\'m useless.\", \"I\\'m no good for anything and I\\'ll never get a job and I\\'m like, I\\'m just hopeless and everyone\\'s better than

nothing really, for me to doyeaAin\\'t getting anyI was doing right?\", \"I was doing all right.\", \"And then I just when I got the job in the school, I was doing all right in the charity show.\", \"Because I was working in a charity shop a couple of mornings, and things seem to be going quite well.\", \"And then I got the job in the school.\", \"And that was two weeks ago.\", \"And and that just struck me that it\\'s just the way they look at me.No, Because they\\'re all looking at me, and they all know how disgusting I am and they all know.\", \"I know they\\'re all they can see what I\\'m thinking and I know that they\\'re thinking I know that they know what\\'s going on you know what I meanI\\'m feeling disgustI can\\'t do this.Just my body like just, I don\\'t know, I feel like eating that just makes my body feel you know, gross like uncomfortable, I don\\'t know.Yeah, yeahRight, Just eating not makes me feel icky.\", \"I don\\'t know.\", \"JustOkay.Well, I feel like just looking at that I\\'ve that cake.\", \"I feel like I just want to run out the door.\", \"I just don\\'t want to be here.Being afraid being a fearful of what will happen if I eat that?I honestly I can\\'t remember.\", \"I don\\'t know.I used to, I used to like it.\", \"I remember that, but it was such a long time ago.Right.Right.\", \"I just see it like, as a big blob of fatThat\\'s it looks like to meA judgement?Mm hmm.Instead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this, and just, you know, check out basically, you want me to go towards it, and, you know, just experience what I\\'m feeling and not go away from it.\", \"Right.Yeah it makes it worse.OkayThis is difficultBut I\\'m doing it, but its difficult.\", \"Doesn\\'t feel comfortable.Right.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, a little bit.I have my bachelor\\'s degree.\", \"And we got a little bit of training.\", \"You know every so often we get some training at work and stuff like that.Yeah, I have a supervisor so they check up on stuff and also like if I feel like I have questions and stuff like that, I can go to them as well.Yeah, I mean, I haven\\'t been fired.\", \"So that\\'s a good sign again,No, I just I kind of feel like maybe the climate has changed a little bit at the office after this happened, like maybe other people think I didn\\'t make the right decision.\", \"I guess maybe that\\'s part of where all my doubts are coming from, like, no one has said to me and I have, you know, my supervisor hasn\\'t called me in and said, I\\'m concerned about this, but I just feel like maybe  other people think that I did something wrong.Yeah.\", \"Which, I guess maybe I shouldn\\'t be that freaked out about because there have been other people who have made mistakes and like, the supervisors have talked to them and, you know, even then they didn\\'t lose their jobs.\", \"So it\\'s not like, you know, I, you know, I don\\'t know, I guess it\\'s not like just hearing them, or thinking that they\\'re judging me is an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake.Yeah, it\\'s kind of like, I know, it\\'s not that big of a deal because, like I said, My supervisor hasn\\'t talked to me and it\\'s not like I\\'ve heard anything terrible about anything happening to the kids or anything like that.\", \"But I just feel like, you know, I have those thoughts like, oh, was she you know, saying something?\", \"You know, when she said that?\", \"Did she was she referring to what happened?\", \"and stuff like that?Yeah.\", \"So like we were having like our regular work week.\", \"And we kind of like, you know, discuss how things are going.\", \"And it\\'s been kind of a big deal what, you know, more so than usual that the kids were removed from this family.\", \"So, you know, one of my co workers kind of nudged me and said, like, oh, you\\'re the bulldozer you, you know, you plowed right through that family took those kids away.\", \"And, you know, I think she meant it kind of, like as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say, like, you know, you did what you needed to do, but it kind of made me feel like does she think that I\\'m just callous?\", \"Like, does she think that I just didn\\'t care and you get what I\\'m saying?Yeah.yeah.\", \"And I guess it kind of like goes back to like my fear that I didn\\'t think it through that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you know, it makes me feel like Was I being mechanical?\", \"Was I just was I just nonchalant about it?\", \"Should I have put more thought into it?\", \"And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt I guess you know.Or even just thoughtful.\", \"I guess maybe I was just being, you know, just going about my job without putting a lot of thought into What I was doing exactly.Yeah, maybe taking a little bit more time.Well, I was raised Catholic.Yeah.\", \"I mean, there\\'s a lot of do\\'s and don\\'ts.\", \"Our church was very like, hell oriented.\", \"Like, if you do this, you\\'re gonna go to hell to do this.\", \"We\\'re gonna go to hell and like, well, let\\'s let that\\'s fun.I mean, sometimes I do.\", \"Feel guilty about what I do.\", \"I feel guilty about, you know, spending more money than I\\'m willing to admit on drugs and parties, but I mean, I think you know, God forgive me.\", \"Hmm.Well, I am Mexican.Well, I\\'m very, very family oriented.Yeah,unsteady, or just really the word?\", \"Yeah.\", \"I mean, usually it\\'s about there\\'s a lot of us in one house.\", \"Like, right now I\\'m living with about six other people.\", \"And, you know, the fight happens or somebody can\\'t pay the rent or I can\\'t pay the rent.\", \"You know, I\\'ve moved probably about 12 times within the past year,Yeah.Yeah, but I could see it having an effect on my kids.\", \"By financial outlook, well, I get assistance from the state.\", \"And I mean, I usually have enough to pay for everything.\", \"I mean, there\\'s been some days that I\\'ve had to tell, you know, my roommate say, Can you lend me some money?\", \"Or my sister\\'s always there if I need that from her?Yeah.much less than I should.I mean, just to kids and getting them down and then taking trying to take some time for myself and sometimes I\\'m up late with, you know, being with people.\", \"smoking, drinking.\", \"I just don\\'t that much.Yeah, I guess.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I really like to get some more sleep.More than I should more, I find myself like snacking a lot during the day.\", \"And I\\'ll still have regular meal.\", \"So it\\'s like meals on top of snacking on top of meals on top of snack and it\\'s just a lot of food.Yeah, I guess I could work on that problem, but I guess now that you mentioned it.\", \"That\\'d be interesting.Yes.\", \"Well, my dad would hit us while we\\'re younger.\", \"And then after he went to jail, um, me and my mom would get into fights, sometimes.Had a few cousins that you know, would step over the line.You know, I punch back.\", \"No, they were they were picking on me.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Because I\\'m small.\", \"I\\'m sure.\", \"You know, my cousin\\'s really towering over me so they would try to disrespect me Because they thought they could.So naivesYeah.My mom always tried to make me like I was the scapegoat a loteven if it was her fault that the lights weren\\'t on and there were no there was no water.\", \"It would somehow be my fault.\", \"No while you\\'re, I had to bail your sister out again.\", \"So you know this happened and I had to drive around town to find your sister because you know, she was just off doing her own thing.\", \"So I spent all the money on gas couldn\\'t pay them like that was always my fault.\", \"Everything was always my fault, even though I knew it wasn\\'t but still harbor.Yeah.physical abuse, I guess I try to end fights with violence, I guess, because I know how bad it can get.\", \"So I\\'ve tried to shut it down really fast, but probably not the most healthiest way.\", \"What\\'s been the honest, that\\'s why I think my sister and me are close.\", \"And so I blame my mom for that because she used me as the scapegoat.\", \"And then my sister was like, Oh, well, that\\'s the bad sister.Yeah.No, not really.main thing is I\\'m just sleeping all the time.\", \"I\\'m really tiredYou know, II\\'m tired when I have to go to work and then I go home and I it\\'s, you know, I just sleep a lot and it\\'s I think it\\'s abnormal.\", \"I haven\\'t been eating as much lately I\\'ve I\\'ve lost a bit of weight and it\\'s just the fact My life so I\\'m just one come inlike just hours like I\\'ll I\\'ll get home from work and I\\'ll take you know three hour nap and then I wake up and you know do do something that I enjoy but that will be bedtime again and I\\'ll be ready for bed even though I took a nap and I\\'ll just sleep some asleep and I can\\'t chance I get I don\\'t wake up early or anything.Yeah, I just I don\\'t know if it\\'s just because I I\\'m sleeping so much I\\'m not eating but I just like when I wake up.\", \"It\\'s not like, Oh, I\\'m hungry.\", \"Nothing like I justI mean, I would say I\\'ve noticed that in the last Two weeks or so, like I\\'mNotice that it\\'s been getting worse.Probably every dayYeah.No, no, not really.Um,nono, I mean, I still like still like all the things I did like all my hobbies.\", \"I like hanging out with friends and stuff.Sometimes it\\'s it\\'s hard for me to,to remember to make plans with people and I just end up sleeping instead.\", \"But I genuinely enjoy it.\", \"So, I\\'d like to go and see if people think of us.\", \"Thanks.I guess I guess likenot so much I can\\'t stop living but I do like try to like, stop it.\", \"I guess I do try to like stop myself.\", \"fidgety.\", \"Right.Yeah, I mean, I like I said I\\'m tired all the time.\", \"I just sometimes I just can\\'t get up and late to work.\", \"Just because I haven\\'t had the energy to get up and stop sleeping, wake up.I mean,I guess yeah, I mean, I\\'m notit sounds harsh, but I\\'m not really a valuable person.\", \"Really, I you know, I don\\'t have a very important job or anything.\", \"No one really depends on me or,I mean, no, not really, but it is.\", \"It is what it is.You know for for a while, you know just you know when you don\\'t contribute very much so it\\'s it is what it isat work?\", \"Yes, definitely.\", \"No.\", \"Because I\\'ll be tired and yawning and even when it comes to like outside of work I guess I\\'ll forget to take plane friends or forget No, no little things just little things that I do forget a lot.\", \"It\\'s hard for me toto pay attention to movies.\", \"Because I\\'m tired or not like I justYeah.No,mean like it was like social life,yeah, I mean I live on my own andyou know like sleeping all the time like I don\\'t see anyone else and it\\'s hard to meet new people.\", \"If I was looking for a relationship I yeah, I would say it affects it because I\\'m not like putting myself out there anything.\", \"And, you know, I forget or I\\'ll sleep instead of making plans with friends on Friday night so that can\\'t be good.\", \"Now, I mean, altering socially.\", \"I haven\\'t reallyNo, it\\'s never happened like that.Thank you.I\\'m still anxious.Well, I looked at the gym and there weren\\'t really any yoga classes, so I didn\\'t I didn\\'t really do that.\", \"I did cut back on my coffee a little bit, but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning.\", \"So, you know, I\\'ve cut back to one cup instead of two cups.\", \"And I did take the dog for a walk.\", \"But I haven\\'t really gotten out other than that.Yeah, I don\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t really like to go out with people.\", \"There\\'s usually a lot of a lot of chatter, a lot of talking and it\\'s hard for me to be in.It just makes me feel a little bit nervous.\", \"And then when I get out there, I don\\'t really, I don\\'t really engage in conversation.I\\'m not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead.Yeah, that\\'s a good idea.Well, I just looked at my gym.\", \"I didn\\'t really look anywhere else because I\\'m already paying To go to a gym, and I don\\'t really want to pay extra to go somewhere else.\", \"So that\\'s why I didn\\'t really look anywhere else.\", \"Maybe about a five or six.Um, well, I, I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it.\", \"So I\\'m interested in doing it, it\\'s just really hard.Well, I haven\\'t done it before.\", \"So it\\'s a little bit hard to get out there because I don\\'t think I\\'m as flexible Other people?Well, I think I think that people go to become flexible.\", \"But I think that maybe some people are already just flexible.Yeah.Well, I\\'m worried I wouldn\\'t be able to do the poses in class.\", \"Well, I feel embarrassed, I think.\", \"And then if the teacher tried to get me to do it, and everybody else would see that they\\'re trying to get me into a pose, and I think it would be embarrassing.I think I feel really good.Right?\", \"I guess it\\'s just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it.The causes are not we\\'re not sure.\", \"Okay.Well, when I was a kid, I used to just practice a stretch a lot, and now that I don\\'t, I don\\'t have the same flexibility.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"So as I\\'ve gotten older, I\\'ve lost a lot of flexibilityI mean, it would be okay.\", \"But I don\\'t I don\\'t like that feeling.Well, I probably feel really good in the end.I didn\\'t really know that.\", \"I just thought that that you\\'ll go was For about flexibility, I didn\\'t realize there were so many other benefits.Well, I probably, if I thought that I\\'d be it would make me less anxious, I think I\\'d probably be around an eight or nine.I think that would be a lot of motivation to continue.It was only about 30 minutes.\", \"It was really cold and windy.\", \"So we didn\\'t want to stay out.\", \"And by we I mean the dog and I Mm hmm.Wow.\", \"It might help if I take a jacket next time.as long as I\\'m just away from road noise and traffic and then it\\'s a lot better.\", \"Okay, and there\\'s lots of trails around my house like that.\", \"Okay,Probably.It\\'s probably attend.\", \"I can I can commit to that.Yeah, If I could do them at home, I would probably do them all the time.\", \"Mm hmm.\", \"I think that would be a big difference.I think it\\'s a 10.\", \"I think I can do them on all four all four.Perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if I were doing them on a regular basis.\", \"Mm hmm.It would make me feel really good.Thank you so much.Good.\", \"How you doing?Yeah.Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, you know, I have this position at work where I have to make these weekly presentations and, and it\\'s killing me.\", \"I can\\'t do it anymore.So it\\'s a it\\'s, it\\'s the executive director and it\\'s 10 managers, we\\'re kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update.\", \"Five minutes or so maybe 10.\", \"At the most if there\\'s an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted.\", \"And but everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around kind of around in a circle.\", \"And you know, depending on where you said is what order you present and basicallyYeah, I feel like it\\'s constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation.\", \"And even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I\\'m so consumed by by this part of my job that I can\\'t I can\\'t do anything else and I normally feel like I do good in my job but but this and, you know, it just, it builds up more like every day the day before is is really bad because I\\'m prepping for the meeting.\", \"And so it really starts to consume me then I don\\'t sleep the night before.\", \"And then by the time you know, I get to the meeting I\\'m, I\\'m so anxious and so nervous, I\\'m panicking and everything, and I just can\\'t.\", \"I just can\\'t.By the beginning of the meeting, when I\\'ve sat down, I\\'m, I\\'m, I feel like I\\'m breathing harder.\", \"I\\'m starting to sweat.\", \"And I feel like my face is turning red.\", \"My palms are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pants.\", \"I My heart is racing.\", \"And I feel like you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse.\", \"I feel like I\\'m breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder.\", \"I feel like everybody can hear it.\", \"My stomach just gets in knots, I feel nauseous.\", \"And I can\\'t, you know, there have been times that I\\'ve managed to like just hold my hand still, and just sit really still.\", \"And I\\'ve tried some deep breathing and just satin and have made it through.\", \"And I have have made it to my, my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words, and I don\\'t say everything I need to even I have a cheat sheet essentially.\", \"And I can reframe it.\", \"I still feel like I\\'m missing things and I\\'m leaving things out and my voice doesn\\'t project so I end up speaking very softly and like I said, I\\'m stuttering, I just can\\'t get it.\", \"Even then, it\\'s it\\'s still I feel like it\\'s still a mess.Well, if I if I manage somehow to get there early enough, and I can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss, or like, like one or two away, then I\\'m actually pretty okay.\", \"Because I can, I can kind of get it over and done.\", \"But so many times I\\'m so nervous and honestly, a bit hungover because I\\'ve been drinking too to try and I don\\'t feel anxious want to drink.\", \"So there have been a lot of times that I\\'ve I\\'ve woken up a little bit late because I\\'ve been drinking.\", \"And so by the time I get there, like one of the last, it\\'s one of the last seats, so I\\'m one of the last to go.\", \"And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more anxious and panicky.\", \"And here in, especially in the last few weeks, I\\'ve had to leave, I can say, I\\'ve got to go.I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything.\", \"So everything stops.\", \"And then and then when it\\'s done, and it goes to whoever\\'s next.\", \"It\\'s like, it\\'s almost like a physical sense of relief.\", \"Like, okay, that\\'s over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable.\", \"I am so, so upset with how I performed that, that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like, What is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again, and I feel so so miserable, that that I\\'ve I feel like I\\'ve disappointed him and I\\'ve so I\\'ve disappointed me.\", \"And I mean, this has always, always happened to me.\", \"For as long as I can remember, I\\'ve never been able to speak in front of groups and you know, from back in college.\", \"If I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there\\'s a way out of it.\", \"And if they refuse, then I wouldn\\'t present.\", \"And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation, and I dropped the class and I took it again, with a different teacher that wouldn\\'t make me present because I couldn\\'t do it.\", \"And High School is the same that I would, you know, I just wouldn\\'t do it.\", \"And actually, this is ridiculous.\", \"You know, I mentioned drinking.\", \"I\\'ve been drinking for a really long time.\", \"When I was like, I don\\'t know like, 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some, like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and I couldn\\'t do that i bolted out of the room and so never been able to do this ever.Um, well if I haven\\'t had to be in front of other people I\\'ve been I\\'ve been kind of okay you know, I can go to the movies but I like to sit on yet and you know, I can go out with with my family and my friends and we can go shopping but I don\\'t like to go to new places.\", \"I like to go kind of like the same places that have familiar Yeah, yeah.\", \"Cuz because I know them.\", \"You know, I know The layout of stores and things like that.Yes, Oh, definitely.\", \"I mean, there\\'s like I said, I mean, I\\'ve run out of the meetings.\", \"There\\'s been times that I\\'ve called in sick when I haven\\'t been there\\'s been times when I\\'ve, I\\'ve said I\\'ve had car trouble arrived so late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation.\", \"I\\'ve actually talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my notes to him or to brief him before after and because I have to say that I have this problem.\", \"I mean, Normal people don\\'t do this, right?\", \"I mean, normal people can make these presents, like the rest of the staff can do it, why can\\'t I?\", \"And so I don\\'t want to tell him that, you know, I that there\\'s something wrong with me.\", \"I mean, it\\'s, it\\'s gotten to the point that I\\'ve talked to him about, you know, this other position that\\'s in another department and transferring so that I wouldn\\'t have to do this anymore.\", \"And and it would it would be a pay cut.\", \"I mean, it\\'s a demotion but I can\\'t live like this.He has told me that he thinks something In a good jobexcuse me, and he doesn\\'t want me to.\", \"Here\\'s what I\\'m going to change positions.\", \"But I can\\'t, I can\\'t do this anymore.Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually.\", \"We were kind of joke about it.\", \"Some times that we all get so nervous.\", \"And my sister, I don\\'t know how but she managed to find a job where she doesn\\'t interact with anybody.It\\'s her in her office with our computer by herself.\", \"And it\\'s just, it\\'s just hurt.\", \"I don\\'t know how she pulled it off.\", \"I mean, she doesn\\'t.\", \"She hardly talks on the phone.And she\\'s really happy and my parents they actually they they met in college.\", \"When my dad after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like, you know, I could tell you\\'re really nervous, but today great and they just they seem to bond over this nervousness that they both had.Yes, please Thank you.In one day, and none of them worked and it was so it was so frustrating because I took so much time out of my work to go and I still couldn\\'t find an appropriate placement for herAgain she needs to get the feel no we can\\'t do that I there there\\'s no way I can take her I can\\'t I couldn\\'t drag her back there.\", \"Either any of those programs.I need your help to find a program that fits herBut But what if they don\\'t work?\", \"How about if II knowI actually came across a program, which is perfect for her.\", \"And I really would like for you to help me see if this could work.\", \"And I\\'d rather for you to try to do that instead of me shopping around for other programs because so far the ones that have been offered me have not worked.I want you to see if, if, if I could choose that program instead of one or the others that you have offered.Right?\", \"I will.\", \"My daughter is 17 years old, okay.\", \"She she\\'s actually very high functioning thankfully.\", \"And, you know, I went to three of these programs.\", \"And none of them worked.Right.\", \"Right.\", \"And, I mean, I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, you know, that would that she really enjoy going to, but, I mean, they were either like babysitting programs or they were just participants were all at like, different developmental levels so that she couldn\\'t really she could make friends.Yeah, they were they were not not good for her.no, she did not she.\", \"She just there just wasn\\'t that that sense of like, that common commonality, you know, just there was no, no basis for like friendships there were there were there were some young people there who are like screaming, yelling and who are talking to them.\", \"And she didn\\'t know how to engage.\", \"Right it Well, I mean, I observed from a whole day each of these programs Okay, which was a lot of time Yeah, yeah.\", \"I mean, like I you know, I work full time and I don\\'t, it was very difficult to schedule time to go to these places.\", \"And once I did, it was just so disappointing.Good.\", \"How are you?Good Good.I mean, he has but I don\\'t it\\'s kind of weird because I\\'m it\\'s actually been great.\", \"It\\'s been great.\", \"It\\'s been great like I\\'ve I mean I used to have issues with mood but I don\\'t anymore and now I just oh for at least you know, last couple days at least.\", \"Maybe about a week.\", \"I don\\'t know I haven\\'t been paying attention but I\\'ve thought awesome like I\\'ve gotten so much done.\", \"You know I do stuff at work.\", \"I do stuff at home.\", \"I went shopping.\", \"I am doing great with Like, well, kinda great with my interpersonal relationships like I was thinking about at work this week, I thought I was like so proud of myself I.\", \"Well, firstly, I got a promotion.\", \"And also, so I was happy with that.\", \"But then I know one of my co workers, he had his birthday.\", \"So I was like, Oh, let me do something nice for him.\", \"And I went home and I baked the cake, but it\\'s kind of annoying, because when I got there, he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn\\'t appreciate the fact that he said over the hill, but he\\'s like, old, so I thought it\\'d be funny, but it wasn\\'t apparently.\", \"But so yeah, besides that, like, this week\\'s been awesome.\", \"And, you know, like I said, I got my promotion and made a lot of money.\", \"Like with a nice increase, I should say.\", \"And I just, yeah, so I\\'ve been feeling awesome.\", \"Getting a lot done.So there\\'s a couple projects at work that I\\'ve been working on.\", \"I got all those done.\", \"And I at home I have been working on my, like unpacking because I moved in kind of a while ago, but I have still had boxes sitting around and stuff.\", \"So I got that all taken care of.\", \"I\\'m completely unpacked.\", \"Over the weekend, I went and bought some, like home decor stuff.\", \"So it really makes the house look just like I want it to look and I\\'m happy with it.I mean, he\\'s worried because I went on a shopping spree so he doesn\\'t really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don\\'t really want to tell him I might I might actually because I\\'m proud of myself like I deserve it and I you know, we\\'re still hard for so long in this company.\", \"And so with the shopping spree was kind of like treating myself.\", \"And so I\\'ve gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money.\", \"I actually maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don\\'t have a lot of bills right now.\", \"Like I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, so I could pay for it.\", \"So that\\'s why he\\'s worried.\", \"And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have like one of those things to attach it.\", \"So it didn\\'t work out.\", \"And so I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn\\'t fit in my car and he couldn\\'t come help me.\", \"So besides I\\'ve been fine.No, not at all.\", \"I mean, like I said, I got approached at work.\", \"My bosses are extremely happy with how productive I\\'ve been how much I\\'m getting done.\", \"The quality of my work, I\\'m able to like, look over the reports and everything I turn in several times before I do it, and I always make sure I do.\", \"So.yes and no.\", \"I mean, yes, because I haven\\'t really been sleeping as much as I used to.\", \"I think I used to sleep too much.\", \"But like, I haven\\'t needed to this week, like, but it hasn\\'t been an issue.\", \"It\\'s actually been a good thing.I\\'m just about an hour and a half.I do feel rested.\", \"I might take a nap later, like a 30 minute nap and then I\\'ll be fine.I do.no  Nothing.\", \"I have, actually.\", \"Yeah.\", \"In the past, I used to I was diagnosed with depression.\", \"And so I know what it feels like.\", \"And I know that like, I don\\'t know anything like that right now.A few years ago, No, not really.\", \"I mean, no.\", \"I mean, obviously you hear about people dying on TV or like friends and family members, but like, I don\\'t dwell on it.\", \"I feel like in the past I might have but I, I haven\\'t beenNo.No, I\\'m healthy.\", \"You\\'re healthy.No, nothing like that ever happenedIs that ok here for him?that\\'s fine.Good?\", \"How are you?Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.Nothing really major.\", \"It\\'s been going on with it.\", \"So I thinkI\\'m getting to a point where it\\'s under control.So works a little bit of a different story.\", \"Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time.\", \"And they like, they don\\'t give me the respect basically, that I deserve.\", \"So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it.\", \"And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again.\", \"But it was worse, even after talking forno.Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers.\", \"Yeah, it justI don\\'t know if there\\'s a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it.\", \"You know,Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically.\", \"So I just I didn\\'t understand.rightI mean, I guess.yeah.I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn\\'t.it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you wereYeah.I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonablewhen I was talking to her outside of the meeting.I\\'ve just been trying not to talk to her.\", \"And obviously, in a work situation, doesn\\'t really help.\", \"So I guess the confrontation I had whetherYeah.\", \"Yeah.So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.being upset and like disrespected and again yeah Well, if we, like go forward, it\\'s the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.like confronted her, It does.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it\\'s cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.Yeah.I mean, I understand But you\\'re saying I get it?\", \"I guess it\\'s just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on.\", \"It\\'s just getting there.\", \"Yes.Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager.\", \"So long timeYeah.Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.Yeah.\", \"For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me.\", \"it\\'s actually mutual respect.\", \"They give me respect I give them respect andWell, I thinkover time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn\\'t get that initial Like,punched in the gut.And I wouldn\\'t have the urge to lash out at her.\", \"Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there\\'s that tension in our office.I\\'d be able to do that Ithink I\\'d be able to approach her and maybe ask her she\\'d want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind oftalking with her.maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting.\", \"And she really didn\\'t mean to undermine me as I said,and then go from there.Yeah.\", \"I certainly don\\'t want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there\\'ll be a bigger issue.I will definitely try.Yeah, it\\'s pretty clear.\", \"You explained it really well.\", \"Thank you.Okay, Sounds great.Thanks.I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn\\'t like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I all my friends were doing it and it was just it\\'s it\\'s not something that I like do okay on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it\\'s nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimesI get what you\\'re coming from but I I really did.\", \"I thought that I had it under control.\", \"And I didn\\'t let myself get too far gone.\", \"I didn\\'t want to be in how do I put this little Like, I want it to be in control.\", \"And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, so I didn\\'t let myself drink too much.Yeah, I understand exactly what you\\'re saying.\", \"AndI don\\'t think I\\'m drinking that much.\", \"I mean, it\\'s, it\\'s mainly for social gatherings.\", \"Like it\\'s nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever.\", \"It\\'s just theevery other weekend, I would say,I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you\\'re coming from.Yeah, I guess I haven\\'t really put it on myself, I guess it\\'s really been forced on their account.\", \"And I\\'ve just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they\\'re doing is a lot of fun.\", \"And I just want to make sure that I\\'m getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.Yeah, I, I do see that.\", \"Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense.\", \"And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking.\", \"Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it\\'s just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely.\", \"I don\\'t I don\\'t really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.I, I just I don\\'t see the problem in it right now.\", \"And maybe it\\'s because I haven\\'t really had that dramatic of an experience.\", \"But,You\\'re right.\", \"I don\\'t want I don\\'t want to be too far gone.\", \"Before it\\'s too late.\", \"Like I, I can imagine something possibly happening where it\\'s to a degree where I can\\'t escape.\", \"And I I guess I\\'ve never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much, or affected anybody close to me that much.\", \"So I guess it\\'s something that I feel like I\\'m in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into an A life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.Okay, right.\", \"okayI guess I\\'m like very observant, like I started looking around, like, I\\'m sweating.\", \"Like I\\'m having physical responses, and I\\'m looking around to see if anyone\\'s already looking at me, like hyper vigilance.Yeah.I mean, I think in that moment, most people are looking at the person who\\'s presenting and not at me.\", \"And so that, you know, I can maybe like, take some deep breaths or try to calm myself down.\", \"Maybe like look over my notes one more time.\", \"Because they\\'re all watching the person who is presenting not me.I mean, like usually have like index cards, or maybe like some stats on something that I want to look over like some numbers or something I don\\'t want to forget.Yeah.Right, exactly enough to not forget them.Right, exactly.a little bit, but with not much success, because usually when I think to remember it, I\\'m in, you know, panic mode, and then it\\'s really hard.Yeah, not often, not consistently.Oh, okay.\", \"I guess.\", \"Okay, and I guess she\\'s fine.No.\", \"No.Most of the timeWell, she\\'s mostly doing a lot of well, she\\'s doing a lot of stuff.\", \"So she\\'s doing

busy of things.Okay, I guess pretty goodLately a little bit stressed because of grandma.they\\'ve been arguing and yelling.\", \"SoYeah, they\\'ve been arguing and yelling.Well, they\\'re just arguing about things are not very nice.\", \"I haven\\'t listened to it very much.\", \"I just go to my room, so it\\'s not very nice.Once, maybe,Or they were just getting really mean like, more than they usually would.\", \"Because it\\'s happening quite a bit now.\", \"I wasn\\'t, wasn\\'t too bad.\", \"I guess.No.No, no.\", \"No.I just go to my room and try to ignore it.They kind of just stay away from each other for a while.\", \"Okay.Well, sometimes my grandma\\'s criticizing me a little bit.\", \"Like she\\'ll tell me I\\'m not doing something right, but then help me with it.\", \"Like, explain it.NoWhat do you mean?noNo, no.\", \"Or my mom pays more attention to my little brother.\", \"And then when I try to talk to my mom, if I want something she really like.\", \"She don\\'t really listen that well.\", \"She just kind of keep doing what she\\'s doing.\", \"And then might later asked me again, what to do more.\", \"Not a lot, though.\", \"Rarely at any time.\", \"I don\\'t really have anyone else no.I don\\'t have anybody should go to my room and think.\", \"Like, I just like being in my room sometimes.noWell, probably because my grandma\\'s fighting and also my dad moving away, because they were divorced.\", \"That\\'s right.I think so.\", \"Probably.A because I\\'m thinking about that.\", \"And then I\\'m not like thinking about what I\\'m doing and then no, get very muchbeen having a rough time.Um, you know, about a week ago, I went out with some friends to a boxing match and I didn\\'t really want to go I\\'ve never I\\'ve never really been to one.\", \"It\\'s not really something I\\'m interested in.\", \"But I was just hanging out with my friends and stuff.\", \"Yeah, I watched a few fights in this this one fight sky.\", \"He nothing was really happening.\", \"I wasn\\'t really into it.\", \"But this guy got knocked out right in front of me.\", \"It was really close to The ring got knocked out right in front of me fell right on his face.\", \"And I just saw him lifeless in front of me.\", \"And I just never said sons have been saved.\", \"I had to leave right away.\", \"I just couldn\\'t.\", \"Couldn\\'t be there anymore.I just felt really, really scared.\", \"You know, my heart started racing.\", \"I kind of didn\\'t really know.\", \"I couldn\\'t focus on what was going on around me.\", \"I just had to get out there.\", \"So you know, I don\\'t even really know what happened to him if he was okay or not.\", \"So I just couldn\\'t handle how I was feeling so I had to leaveYeah, pretty much daily for the past week.\", \"I got home that night.\", \"I couldn\\'t sleep You know, it took me almost all night to fall asleep and then at work on Monday, I was having a lot, a lot of problems there.I couldn\\'t focus on anyone was talking to me at a meeting on Tuesday.\", \"And my boss was you know, talking for a while and I just, I felt like I couldn\\'t concentrate at all you know, everything is kind of just a blur around me.Yeah, I think about it a lot.\", \"Pretty much all the time.Yeah if I\\'m at work trying to get some paperwork done or something, it just pops in my mind and I can\\'t make it go away.\", \"I haven\\'t really been dreaming about it barely sleepingNo not really just think about it a lotYeah.\", \"With my meeting, people started clapping.\", \"You know was big cheering and That kind of made me feel really, really bad again, my heart was racing, start sweating and just kind of reminded me of being there and start thinking about it again.\", \"So, things like that, you know, pump up music when it comes on the radio, same kind of music they played there.\", \"Kind of makes you feel the same way my heart starts to race.\", \"It just kind of feel like I need to get away from it.Yeah.\", \"I\\'ve been trying to avoid the radio because you never know what\\'s going to come on on the radio.\", \"So I\\'ve been avoiding listening to music in case something like that happens and putting crowdsNo, I can.\", \"I can pretty vividly remember it.\", \"It\\'s pretty clear toYeah, you know, just out of nowhere.\", \"Something doesn\\'t go the way I wanted to I just kind of snap on people.\", \"And that\\'s not like me at all.\", \"I usually am pretty easygoing.\", \"And, you know, people, my boyfriend, for instance, right?\", \"I yelled at him the other day for not putting the toilet paper on the roll.\", \"And that\\'s not something I\\'d usually care about.\", \"It\\'s just, it\\'s not me.kind of depends.\", \"Sometimes I kind of feel like I\\'m in a daze and don\\'t really know what\\'s going on around me.\", \"But um, I\\'ve been one of the students that I work with the the pop up out from behind the door, which he would do all the time.\", \"And you know, typically, I would laugh and think it was funny before but he did the other day and I just could not control myself afterwards.\", \"Like, I couldn\\'t calm myself down.\", \"You know, I didn\\'t think was funny at all.\", \"It really, really scared me.\", \"And that went on for about 1015 minutes and I just my heart was racing.\", \"I had to go take a walk and just really hard to relax and after that,Definitely.No, noNoYeah, I think that would be really helpful.Okay, thanksNoWell, remember I had told you that they were downsizing at my job.So I, you know, been there 20 years at my job.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And they\\'re downsizing lately and they let me go.No, no, no.\", \"So yeah, it\\'s just, you know, they let me go.\", \"I have really nothing to go on.\", \"I don\\'t know what to do.\", \"I\\'ve been at that.\", \"job so long.\", \"I really don\\'t know how to do anything else.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I was, I thought, you know, I envision doing that job for a long time.\", \"So, you know,Oh, it\\'s awful.\", \"I mean, we definitely my husband and I, it\\'s really spiraled out of control.\", \"My husband and I have kind of like, joint, we pay the bills together.\", \"And so this was half of our income, and that\\'s gone.\", \"And because it was kind of more sudden, we didn\\'t really have time to do anything else, you know, time to prepare.were a little bit.\", \"Yeah, so far.\", \"But if I don\\'t find the job soon, then I don\\'t know what\\'s gonna happen.\", \"I don\\'t know how bad it\\'s gonna getMy husband usually deals with the bills, so I\\'m not quite sure.\", \"But probably in another month or so it\\'s going to get really bad for about a month.All sorts.\", \"I mean, I, I\\'ve worried that, you know, like, my husband and I are arguing because we\\'re under all this stress.\", \"I worry, we\\'re gonna lose our house.\", \"You know, I\\'m worried I\\'m going to be homeless.\", \"You know, it\\'s embarrassing.\", \"I don\\'t have a job now.\", \"What if I don\\'t find another job?\", \"You know, what are my kids gonna do?\", \"My kids are, you know, relying on us to meet their needs.\", \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"So I mean, we could be homeless.\", \"I might not ever get a job again, you know, I\\'m not getting any younger.\", \"So I just am afraid that I won\\'t get another job.Yeah.I\\'m not sure I\\'m still looking into that.I just have my bachelor\\'s.YeahNot that No.Not that I was aware of that.\", \"I think maybe it maybe like one A while ago, but it was a pretty good job.\", \"So.\", \"Yeah.Yeah, one of my friends was in a similar field and he left the job and eventually found another job.\", \"You know how long it took.\", \"It took a while.\", \"It took a while.\", \"Like, maybe like two years or so at least almost, yeah, it was a struggle for their family.\", \"So I think about thatI mean, probably part of it maybe full would be ideal because, you know, we were comfortable the way we were living so far would be ideal, but you know, we could probably survive on on part of it, it just not as well as we were living.I mean, I\\'ve been trying to think of think of, you know, different opportunities that might be open to me now and you know, being able to spend more time with my kids and things like that.\", \"I\\'ve been trying to think of it other ways my situation.I\\'ve thought about it, but I\\'m really having a hard time with it.What would it mean about me is That I think if I only had a part time jobs that I wasn\\'t qualified, that I wasn\\'t good enough for full time.Yeah.Well, right now it\\'s not good.\", \"Well, I mean, I\\'ve been arguing with my husband, I\\'ve been drinking a lot more, you know, the depression has come back a lot worse.\", \"So it\\'s just starting to become the cycle where you know, drinking and getting into arguments and situations not getting better and it just keeps snowballing keeps snowballing.but it\\'s hard when I\\'m really depressed and the situation\\'s not getting better.\", \"And I\\'m just home sitting about, you know, drinking, while everyone else is carrying on with their life, and I\\'m stuck here.Really?\", \"No, it\\'s not helping.\", \"I\\'ve been thinking about, you know, trying to get more organized, like we talked about before with the finances and, and trying to, you know, figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want, what to do and maybe by baby steps, so it\\'s not like, so overwhelming for me like the thought of getting a new job and making enough money and providing for my family.\", \"And like breaking it down.I think just sometimes like the fear of the unknown, like, worry about what if this never happens for me?\", \"You know, what if I don\\'t get a job?\", \"You know, what if we lose our house?I mean, worst case, if we don\\'t get a job, I mean, probably.\", \"I don\\'t know, like, get a smaller house, or find a way around it.\", \"I mean, she would need to have some tough times.\", \"Right?\", \"So like, it would be difficult but I think if I really thought about it, you know, we would probably get through it.I mean, I think when I really think about it, you know, like you said, I think I\\'m less depressed or think that I, you know, I\\'m more able to cope with it.\", \"You know, knowing Okay, well, this is the worst that could happen, but maybe it\\'s not as bad as I thought.\", \"would be embed.\", \"Yeah.Okay.YeahOkay, thanksOkay.I\\'m just here.Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards.yeah, so about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, so that the government can\\'t hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors.\", \"And I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and just picked out a tool and brought it back to the house.\", \"And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital.\", \"So it\\'s like, see the government data to getThey\\'re trying to stop me from actually creating my room.\", \"Because they\\'re, they\\'re creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them.\", \"And I\\'m not a follower.\", \"And I know what I want.\", \"And I know what I need.\", \"And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need.\", \"And I\\'m just trying to protect them by creating my room.So I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending you through the lights and also through the TV and like through every electronic apparatus that is out there.\", \"And I\\'m actually creating doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening.\", \"So that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room.\", \"And anytime I\\'m basically in there I was, it was good.\", \"I had energy.\", \"I didn\\'t have everything that I wanted.\", \"But my prototype was running out of fuel.\", \"And so I needed to make it bigger, larger, so it can run longer.Yeah, that\\'s what I was trying to do when I wouldn\\'t borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online.\", \"And they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor\\'s house.\", \"It could have been all perfect and set so that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in.\", \"And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could just be happy.I was happy, like, so two weeks ago, I was I was good.\", \"I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create.\", \"So I can actually build my base in my system.\", \"But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because I need sleep.\", \"I wasn\\'t tired.\", \"And if I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes, just because I needed to finish what I was going to do.\", \"And I was so close to finishing and my neighbour called cops.Doesn\\'t everybody do that?I felt good.\", \"Like when I when I sleep I don\\'t like when I sleep because it just feels wrong.I\\'m alright guy.\", \"All right.\", \"Just All right, right now.\", \"The government maybe get on different medication.\", \"So just all right.not sad either.\", \"It\\'s just you In the middleof course who doesn\\'t want to get back to the happiness of their life.\", \"That\\'s the reason why you need to finish machineum, I think I ordered probably know the exact number I ordered 236 hard drives, because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom, so I can always be happy and if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered.\", \"But then within that 236 it also covered my house so that my family could be happy, and like my four neighbors around us so we can all be happy.\", \"And that\\'s the reason why I\\'m kind of angry at my one neighbor because I was including his house in all By my grid so that he can also be happy all the time.Of course, he\\'s the helping hand.\", \"He helped me out.\", \"He let me borrow his tools.\", \"but evidently he didn\\'t let me borrow him this time.\", \"So just pull him out.\", \"Have another neighbor take his place.I don\\'t know.\", \"When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment.\", \"I found my mom\\'s purse and I was just like, oh my god, she has a credit card in there.\", \"Oh my god, I can use our credit card.\", \"So I was using our credit card because it\\'s trying to make her happy.\", \"And so I don\\'t know I added the 236.\", \"They were probably 50 to $100 apiece, depending on where it could get them and I just ordered them.My mom came to the hospital and was like, where are all these boxes coming from?\", \"It\\'s like this, but I\\'m in my room.\", \"And she put them into my room.\", \"And then, like a week ago, she has, like, I see my credit card, and she wants to happen.No, that\\'s just how we have a relationship generallywe get along perfectly fine.\", \"Like that\\'s, that\\'s how we talk to each other.\", \"Like, we talk to each other minimally, because she\\'s not in my room, so she\\'s not happy.\", \"So anytime she does come into my room, it messes up the balance.\", \"So I get unhappy, and then I just tell her to stay out so that I can be happy and she can be happy in her own place.The government changed for Medicationswhile soYes, I want to be back in my happy place.\", \"Now?\", \"I haven\\'t been that motivated.\", \"Big.\", \"I know I\\'m going to get it done.\", \"It\\'s just I just don\\'t know if I\\'m gonna get it done today or tomorrow, but I know what\\'s gonna get done.it\\'s really important because I Can\\'t be controlled by the government anymore.The Counselor has been okay.Thank you.I do well, thanks for asking.\", \"Yeah, I\\'m, I\\'m recently married.\", \"And so my husband and I moved in together.\", \"And up until then I I\\'ve lived by myself.\", \"My whole adult life.\", \"So apparently the craziest things have been happening.\", \"While I\\'ve been sleeping.\", \"several, several nights I\\'ve woken him up screaming.\", \"I\\'m screaming.\", \"Apparently a very vulgar, profane, profane the words and So that\\'s a little alarming to him.\", \"And I\\'ve even, you know, we\\'ve been hitting him in the middle of the night.\", \"You know, he\\'s waking up with these huge bruises on his arms.\", \"And so yeah, apparently, a behavior in the middle of the night is out of hand.Yes.\", \"Um, I participated in a sleep study and what they say they rolled out some some other things and thought that maybe it was a behavior, Sleep Disorder.\", \"So they have referred me to you, I\\'m still working with them.\", \"Now.\", \"They\\'re still running some tests and everything but they thought maybe there are some other stressors or underlying things, soColby?\", \"Um, well, I\\'m just little worried that it\\'s going to affect my marriage and that my husband will not be able to deal with that.\", \"So I would just really like to figure out how to keep my relationship with Him successful with it.\", \"So overcome these issues.Usually I wake up and he\\'s like, what are you doing?\", \"I was having the worst dream.\", \"So those dreams are kind of what he\\'s telling me are aligning.\", \"What my behavior is, my dreams are aligning with those.\", \"So you know, I don\\'t feel anything.\", \"It doesn\\'t feel like I\\'ve been anything.\", \"I have.\", \"I\\'ve met a couple times and woken up, but no people do that.\", \"So I didn\\'t really think anything of it.\", \"But now I\\'m starting to wonder.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s it\\'s a little strange.\", \"So Oh, concerning.Yeah, I mean, I would, I wouldn\\'t have known.\", \"I\\'ve lived by myself.\", \"But you know, I, before I had fallen out of bed a couple times, and, you know, my sheets and pillows are always everywhere when I wake up, but I didn\\'t really think anything of it.\", \"So kind of making the connections now.after you go to sleep?\", \"I\\'m in the middle of the night he has.\", \"He said at first he thought I was joking around But, yeah, no, no, I am waking him up, you know.\", \"SoNo.that he\\'s, he\\'s usually around electronic cash snapping he says it hasn\\'t happened and so.\", \"Alright.Yeah.Yeah, that would probably be helpful for him to kind of get this side of things too.Yes, yes.It\\'s been it\\'s been helpful.\", \"Thank you.\", \"Prepare healthMy daughter has been, she\\'s actually been sick.\", \"And so she had a fever yesterday and they started her on an antibiotic and I had to go pick it up from the drugstore, and that\\'s like, I don\\'t usually go there.\", \"It\\'s hard to get there.\", \"Like it\\'s not right in the neighborhood.\", \"So any expressways or bridges to get there, not expressways, but It\\'s busy, it\\'s busier and attracting a mall.\", \"So you know, there are six lanes four lanes.\", \"Yeah.\", \"So it just, it\\'s not someplace I usually would go.\", \"And if I was going to go, usually I would either have her go with me or my husband go with me, but she was sick and he was at work.\", \"AndI\\'m just, you know, I\\'m sort of thinking about going there.\", \"And I\\'m already starting to think well, you know, what, what if you know what if, what if I\\'m driving and somebody crashes into me What if I\\'m driving and I can\\'t do it?\", \"You know, what if I just have to stop because I can\\'t do it anymore and, you know, it was raining and I\\'m sort of like, I\\'ve got this picture of myself like out in the middle of the road and you know, what\\'s the picture look like?\", \"You\\'re out in the middle of the road and stranded and it\\'s dark and my you know, you know, my shoes are gone.\", \"I\\'m just like, it\\'s like I it would be a million miles to get back home.\", \"pretty miserable.Oh, terrifying.\", \"Yeah.\", \"And I just it\\'s so hard to get there.My feelings I mean it things are inside like ago anxiety, physical things are going on.\", \"Well fear and anxiety and I just feel really shaky and I feel really like lightheaded and dizzy and I just don\\'t feel like I can breathe very well andbut it\\'s getting there not quite to a panic.Yeah.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah, it feels like it might.\", \"Yeah,the driver having to drive to the, to the pharmacy,So the like the what ifs?someone runs into me.What if I get stranded?I can\\'t do it.I think what if I would if I can\\'t get back home?\", \"I can\\'t get back on.Yeah.\", \"What if I end up on this road forever?Oh, I\\'d say about an ADWell, I yeah.\", \"I sort of felt like I might fall over.\", \"I, my heart was pounding and I didn\\'t feel like I canI went to the pharmacy.\", \"He did do it.\", \"I had to okay.It was so bad.\", \"I just, you know, I, I think I left permanent marks on the steering wheel, because I was whole time.But I really had no choice.\", \"I mean, I think usually I wouldn\\'t go to the pharmacy.\", \"Usually.\", \"I would call my husband and say can you pick it up on your way home, getWell, I feel better.\", \"You feel better.\", \"It\\'s like such a relief.Well, yeah, cuz I don\\'t have to, like,Well, I feel like I don\\'t really have much confidence when it comes to this to be able to doI don\\'t feel like I can do I can\\'t I can\\'t do it.I mean, I think almost everybody, I think most people drive without too much.\", \"problem but like, my sister loves to drive.\", \"Yeah, I mean, she just she drives every opportunity she gets.I was thinking that I hope that this doesn\\'t like make me worse.\", \"Okay, no, like, trying to do some of these things.Well, I think that that would if I could do those things that would be really nice.\", \"Yeah,Yeah, Yeah, that\\'s okay.No, everything\\'s fine.Crap.just crap.\", \"Just don\\'t care about anything, don\\'t want to do anything.just lying in bed all day, doing nothing.\", \"Just thinking, I\\'ve got these, these thoughts.\", \"Any thoughts of dyingAll the time, every day.I think I\\'ll probably jump over a bridge.there\\'s a really high bridge near my house the swing bridge.\", \"It\\'s it\\'s really high so I know I\\'ll die if I jump off.\", \"There\\'s also a train track underneath.\", \"So if the fall doesn\\'t kill me then the train willI\\'m thinking, thinking all the timeMy mom, she\\'d probably be really upset if I did it but things have just gotten worse and I can\\'t take it anymore.I\\'ve been looking at bus timetables today.\", \"The bus that goes by the bridge.\", \"Yeah, I think I\\'m gonna do it tonight.\", \"Just can\\'t take it anymore.\", \"She can\\'t treat me this way.Like what?Yeah, I cut up my links.\", \"Today yesterday every day.No, just cuttingNo and never have anyone else.No, I don\\'t think so.Just mum and jack is my younger

won\\'t tell anyone.No.NoThat\\'s okay.Yeah, that\\'s fine.\", \"Can I have a coke?Uh, you know, when I print them out properly, they\\'re working pretty well, but whatever.\", \"Yeah.\", \"It\\'s really making me feel guilty about smoking so i have been smoking less.\", \"I don\\'t know.\", \"It\\'s, it kind of sucks.\", \"To be honest.\", \"It was late.\", \"Last shift, and my boss was like giving me that, you know, stare of like death.\", \"And I\\'m like, you know, thinking, why do I keep doing this?I just I keep missing the bus.\", \"And that\\'s a stupid excuse.Like 10 times.Yeah.Yeah, it\\'s it\\'s in my face, but it\\'s not in my way.\", \"Kind of good in that little corner there.\", \"So it\\'s been pretty good.Mostly, I really need to use pens and stuff are not where they should be.\", \"SoLooks good.\", \"I like the black.\", \"It\\'s nice and simple.Well, Black is not a color though.\", \"It\\'s a shade.Ah, I missed my deadlines like, you can imagine.\", \"So, to get the wait until next round,did I put that in the calendar?\", \"I saw them and I\\'m like, Okay, there you are good.\", \"AndWhy did I miss this thing?\", \"Well, yeah.\", \"I mean, yeah, me pragmatically.\", \"I think I\\'ve got some, you know, I\\'ve got some anchors to kind of work around.All right, cuz I\\'m on that page.\", \"Let me show you.\", \"Oh, Well, I didn\\'t need it anymore.\", \"three weeks.\", \"No smoking.I do.\", \"I can taste again.\", \"I can breathe again.\", \"It\\'s kind of amazing.It\\'s a start.Oh job situation I went to check out it\\'s a kind of drop in for this one gig atthis place on King Street.\", \"It was a restaurant andI just didn\\'t i didn\\'t think through it.\", \"Like, basically dinnertime and I went in there, you know, so that didn\\'t exactly impress them very much.\", \"And I think that was probably a really short sighted thing of me to do so.Which lists?No, I did.\", \"I I mean when I remember to, yes.Looks good.\", \"So that looks like the most common sense to do.I didn\\'t even check Hold on.\", \"Probably says on there some more places places.\", \"All right there at the end where you can\\'t read it.\", \"So what is that?Well, I can\\'t I can\\'t not have a stick right in front of me.\", \"That\\'s good.\", \"And I\\'ll just leave all right there.I\\'ll put I\\'ll maybe I\\'ll set the timer for that.\", \"I mean, how are you want to do it?I got some stuff here.\", \"And mostly I\\'m remembering to do it.I could check some of these off.\", \"Actually, that might feel good.That yoga mat check.Yeah, there\\'s a coupleHow\\'s that sound?\", \"Maybe part of the celebration is me treating you too.\", \"Cuz I think it would be nice for changeYeah, I mean, it\\'s making me think like, you know, if I just had some desk job, like if I just crunched numbers or something, I would never have to have this responsibility.\", \"Like, why would they trust me with a job like this?\", \"Like, I\\'m just a human being who, you know, doesn\\'t know any better than any other person and I just don\\'t know if I can do this.\", \"It\\'s just so much responsible.\", \"And I guess, I guess before I felt like I could handle it.\", \"And now I just feel like it\\'s so much responsibility for one person.\", \"And I don\\'t think that I can handle it anymore.\", \"But I don\\'t want to change jobs because I\\'ve been here for so long.\", \"And I liked it before.\", \"I don\\'t know.Yes,I feel like it\\'s just around the corner.\", \"And this isn\\'t even resolved.\", \"I\\'m still afraid of the consequences of this, you know, like, what if, you know, you know, these kids are out of their parents home.\", \"And I just feel like what if something bad happens to them where they are now and then that\\'s going to fall on me and, you know, people, like other my co workers know that I\\'m the one that did this.\", \"So like, if something happens to the kids, like, I\\'m going to be the one that they\\'re going to blame for it.Yeah.\", \"Because, you know, before that, I guess, you know, probably nobody else would have known about it.\", \"So I made the report about what was going on.\", \"And I think Yeah, as a direct result.I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, it wasn\\'t going great for the kids.\", \"It wasn\\'t really great environment.\", \"But I just feel like if I had left it alone, I don\\'t know that the kids would be with their parents.Yeah, I mean, I guess.\", \"I guess I feel like it\\'s probably wasn\\'t great for them to be there.\", \"I mean, that\\'s why I made the report.\", \"That\\'s my job, but it just feels like, you know, I just feels like I\\'m playing God.\", \"You know what I mean?\", \"Like, I\\'m just coming in here and spend like 5-10 minutes with a family and then totally turn their whole world upside down.Yeah.Well, I mean, like I said, I thought they were using drugs in the home.\", \"So that\\'s like a really dangerous situation for kids to be in, because you don\\'t know what kind of people are coming in and out of the home, if their parents are going to be, you know, coherent enough to help them if there\\'s an emergency or if the parents are even making them food and taking care of their needs and stuff like that.\", \"So I guess in that sense, that\\'s really concerning.\", \"And that\\'s a big part of the reason why I made the report.I don\\'t know.\", \"I guess that\\'s just the hardest part for me is like, I feel like I can\\'t make the right decision.\", \"I just feel like I don\\'t know if I\\'m equipped to be the person to make that kind of decision.Yeah, definitely.\", \"That\\'s the uncertainty, anxiety.Umm I\\'m doing okay, I guess.\", \"Umm I guess something happened over this past week.\", \"I have been looking for a new job since I left my last one.\", \"And I found I found this really good job on the internet.\", \"But the problem is that the job is working with kids and they they have to do a drug test in order for me to get the job.\", \"And it kinda like it made me think it made me think a little bit more about something that I\\'ve been considering for a while which is kind of just given up, given up we\\'d forget like it I\\'m thinking about it for a while.\", \"But okay, I also kind of think about the way the way we\\'d really helps me and like, if I\\'m ever feeling like really, really anxious about something I mean, we kind of have to chill out and hope to relax and I just don\\'t know if I\\'m ready to give that up yet.Yeah, it does.\", \"It\\'s a it\\'s a good way to self medicate in a wayYeah.right.\", \"Yeah, it\\'s I mean, it\\'s kind of like it\\'s put me in a difficult spot like I definitely I definitely want to get that job but you know, if I cut it if I cut out smoking like, I don\\'t know what else I would do, like if I if I started to have a panic attack or if if I was really like anxious about Like anything that I\\'m worrying about, like i don\\'t i don\\'t know what i did copes.Um, I did therapy for a little bit, but it was like, I don\\'t know, back then it was kind of like when the anxiety was just starting, so it wasn\\'t too big of a problem.\", \"So I like I quit there because it wasn\\'t really doing that much.\", \"Yeah.I mean, like, if I\\'m bored or maybe if I\\'m like hanging out with buddies, like, I don\\'t really have a reason not to do it.\", \"I can tell now, but it wasn\\'t like, like, I really use it whenever I\\'m like feeling really anxious about something.If I didn\\'t have like any kind of anxiety?Umm like it was so be kind of tough to give up.\", \"Because like, if I\\'m hanging out with my buddies and they offer it to me like that\\'s that\\'s always pretty chill but I don\\'t like I really I\\'m really looking forward to this job and like the benefits of having that job without weighing the benefits of just like smoking smoking with my buddies soI am?\", \"Yeah, it\\'s it\\'s almost kind of a dream job.Well, it\\'s working with it\\'s working with kids with autism in the school.\", \"So like, I would be kind of like, almost like a personal TA in a way.\", \"So like, it\\'s part of an inclusion program.\", \"So when the kids are going into the class, like I would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like help them out in case something comes up.\", \"And it\\'s just my brother has autism that\\'s like it\\'s that\\'s something that I\\'ve always really kind of wanted to work with.HmmIt is it\\'s like a catch 22 because it\\'s like, I know the job will be great, but it\\'s like it\\'s a it\\'s a big step for me to take that job.\", \"And it\\'s, it\\'s gonna be super umm It\\'s gonna make me super anxious.\", \"You know, it\\'s gonna be like, it\\'s gonna be a lot of anxiety taking a new job.\", \"So it\\'s like, if I have to give up the marijuana and then like, not have another way to cope with anxiety, like to get the job.\", \"It\\'s like a catch 22No  I mean, not really No.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, pretty much.I think if the therapy really worked, I would be able to, like, it\\'s just so easy now just to kind of light up.\", \"Like, that\\'s an easy fix.\", \"And, like, I don\\'t think therapy is going to be that instant.\", \"So like it would, it would be tough.\", \"I think if I had real confidence that the therapy would work, I could do it.\", \"But I mean, it was I have to it would definitely have to work like I just as well as as smoking.\", \"Yeah, yeah, definitelyAfter a while, like after I got used to this job, but like just starting the new job would make me kind of anxious.\", \"And then like it would be tough not not to smoke or doing that.\", \"Like I don\\'t I don\\'t want to get on a drug test anymore because like it\\'s it\\'s being decriminalized being legalized so many places, and there\\'s so much research, saying that it\\'s not that bad.\", \"It\\'s kind of like, it\\'s really upsetting that the place that I really want to work sas that policy, I think it\\'s really silly.Yeah, it\\'s Yeah.Right..\", \"Yeah, it\\'s either They will be legalized in like in the state in a couple of years.\", \"But until then, like,I mean, I can\\'t wait that long to start start working soRight?\", \"Yeah, it\\'s still a problem.Hmm.RightYeah.\", \"And I would, it\\'s it sounds so pathetic to be like, No, I don\\'t want to take my dream job because I need weed like, sounds really stupid.I don\\'t like I\\'m, I\\'m still kind of on the fence because like if I if I have to give it up for the job, I could do that.\", \"But I would definitely need, like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety.\", \"Like, whether it\\'s therapy or whether it\\'s like something else I yeah, I would, I would definitely need like a substitute if I got rid of it for good.\", \"YeahRight.Yeah.\", \"Yeah, definitely.\", \"Right?\", \"Yeah.\", \"I mean, I mean, if I really thought that I could, like get some kind of treatment that was as good as weed.\", \"Yeah, I mean, I could maybe quit, especially the house to get the job, especially.Yeah, yeah, I mean, that would be the best the best outcome.Yeah, I think so.\", \"I think I could give up record, like, doing it with my buddies recreationally.\", \"I could, yeah, I\\'m just going to have a cigarette.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.I mean, the job.\", \"It has a high turnover rate, so Like, even if I think I need to apply this week, but if I don\\'t get in more than likely another position like it will open up, like within a month or two.It would be like, Oh, all right after I apply, so I applied and then did the interview.\", \"That\\'s when they will give him the paperwork.\", \"And I have to go get drug tested on.just a couple days ago.Yeah, yeah, it\\'s uh, yeah.\", \"So I like I wouldn\\'t be able to do, I wouldn\\'t be able to make it this application.\", \"But I would like to be off it by the next one.rightYeah, yeah, I could deal with that.All right.\", \"Yeah.\", \"Sounds good.YeahThank you.I\\'m not too good man.Yeah.\", \"So something happened over this past week I was I was driving to my buddy\\'s house and I forgot that my tags for my car is  expired earlier this month.\", \"So I got pulled over for that and then I don\\'t know why I did this but the cop asked to search my car and I was like, yeah, that\\'s fine like whatever because he said he had two searches.\", \"This is getting towed.\", \"And I completely forgot that I had my junk bag in the trunk.\", \"So we opened the trunk and he was looking through the bag.\", \"So he found me he found everything.\", \"I had my weed in there at the bottom the pipe like all my pieces.\", \"So I got a, I got in trouble for possession.\", \"So I just I just want him to court and the judge offered me this decision.\", \"He said that I could either do two weeks of community service like about 80 hours, or I could pay $1,000 fine.\", \"And I\\'m trying to I\\'m really trying to figure out which one really which one would be better I guess, the both kind of suck butRight.Right.No, I mean, it\\'s it\\'s really not a problem like it\\'s just they don\\'t really want it problem is that I got caught like I\\'m doing good in school works fine.\", \"So obviously like marijuana is other than just going to court It has never been a problem.Rightjust picking up crap inside of the road?Yeah.I do, but I have I got a vacation coming up and I definitely like I want to I want to keep the money for like a little little vacation we\\'d like do some, some fun stuff with my buddies.\", \"Definitely like I want to keep that money.\", \"But I mean, I also like the community service is like also kind of close to the vacation so I might have to like give up part of the vacation or to to do the two weeks so that I think that didn\\'t really help my decision either.I mean, really, like they both they both have the same negative, I guess like, like if I if I do the community service that I like, you know, I do get to keep the money.\", \"But I mean other hand, like if I keep the money, I\\'m doing community service, like I\\'m not gonna have all the time to spend the money.\", \"So it\\'s now I mean, neither really have a positive and both the negatives are kind of equal to so it\\'s it\\'s kind of tough to choose.Right.rightRight.I mean, that\\'s obviously pretty high.\", \"Like, I guess keeping the money, it\\'d be like a nine.\", \"Because if I, like if I, if I keep the money, obviously, I can, like use it for other other things.\", \"I\\'d say probably nine.\", \"Right.Right.\", \"Yeah, I mean, I guess that\\'s true.\", \"Like, I didn\\'t think about it in that way, like if I if I give up the the two weeks of time, like, obviously that would suck, but like I have, I guess I have more of a choice of what to do with money compared to my time.\", \"You know, so I guess I could think about it that way mayberight.Maybe like, I guess maybe about a seven because the like the community service, I mean, it wouldn\\'t be that bad.\", \"Obviously, like, it would be a waste of time.\", \"We\\'re gonna have to do this crap work for for so long, but I don\\'t know.\", \"Like, at least I know if I do the community service and it would be like done after this amount of time.\", \"You know, so I can I can always keep that in mind.RightYeah, yeah.\", \"Yeah, I guess cuz I never like I never thought about scaling it like that way.\", \"So yeah, I think so.\", \"by the end of the week So today\\'s Tuesday, so I have like a couple of days to think it over.on Friday, yeah.\", \"When I get the decision.rightRightrightAll right.\", \"Yeah, I think I can do that.\", \"Yeah, give me some more.\", \"Yep, sounds good.\", \"I\\'m pretty good.\", \"How are you Dr.\", \"Grande ?Um, so I\\'ve, I\\'ve been applying to doctor programs for this upcoming fall.\", \"And I\\'m like, I\\'m kind of stuck because I got into two of the schools that that I was looking at.\", \"I get and like I got into both of them and both of their programs are really good.\", \"Both of them have like great research track records and kind of what I want to do.\", \"And yeah, but the problem is is like I don\\'t know how to decide between the two now.HmmRight.Yeah.\", \"Um, yeah, like I\\'ve always I\\'ve always had trouble, like, within decisiveness and it\\'s like, when I, when I had two choices of something that\\'s very similar, like I always I always get stuck.\", \"And I like, it\\'s very hard for me to actually like make a decisionright.Yeah.I mean, really not, not any that I can think of like, I\\'ve tried to, like, I\\'ve tried to write them down the piece of paper, do the pros and cons and like the pros look very close.\", \"And it\\'s like the same number, but I mean, both programs are good.\", \"I have connections with like the some of the teachers and both of them.\", \"They\\'re both in the same city.\", \"Like they\\'re really close to each other.\", \"They\\'re, they\\'re both very similar, but like, for some reason, I just, I don\\'t know, it would be easier if there\\'s like some cons to one of themrightrightYeah.rightrightUm, well, definitely, the research is up there.\", \"I definitely want to get that out of out of whichever school I go to.\", \"I think something else that\\'s important is for the university to have kind of like maybe a post doctorate plan, whether they have connections with, like businesses where I can get a job like right after graduate or, like if I was going to move into a faculty position, like if they kind of had a pathway that would help set me up for that like that.\", \"Those are probably the biggest, like the biggest influencers,right.brightRightOkay, right.\", \"rightUm, actually, that\\'s I never thought about like that.\", \"Like, I guess I could go online and kind of look at a lot of times universities put up like job acceptance rates like afterwards and they put up percentages, kind of like what what people do afterwards.\", \"So maybe if I looked at the websites and kind of found information and see like, how many of them go on to be professors or like work in the industry, maybe maybe I should check that out.\", \"That might help merightright.Okay.Yeah, that makes sense.\", \"Yeah.OkayOkay.right, right, Okay.Yeah.\", \"Yeah.\", \"I never actually thought about ranking the the pros and going from there.\", \"So I think that\\'s a good idea.\", \"Yeah.Okay.Right.\", \"Okay.\", \"Yeah, that makes sense.\", \"No, no, I think, yeah, I think I know what I can do afterwards, no we decided.Alright sounds good.HmmHiThank you.feeling pretty intense.\", \"Things have kind of gone downhill since I was here last time.Yeah.I think that we\\'ve just sort of fallen back.\", \"You know, I was really hopeful that and with the proposal also came the promise to, you know, work on the relationship and work on anger and work on, you know, being the couple that we we hope to be, and that it\\'s not happening its not happening.\", \"We\\'re right back to where we were.\", \"I just I don\\'t I don\\'t know how to make change.\", \"I don\\'t know how to I don\\'t know how to end this.\", \"I don\\'t know how to get out.\", \"I don\\'t know how to.\", \"I just I can\\'t do it anymore.I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, I want to I don\\'t want to be in it.\", \"But I don\\'t, I don\\'t know how to get to not being in it.Yeah.I don\\'t know.\", \"It just feels so overwhelming when I think about it.\", \"I just I can\\'t seem to find a way out of it.\", \"and that feels feels ethical.\", \"It feels like it can No, I don\\'t want to hurt her.\", \"I just don\\'t want to be in this relationship anymore.It\\'s not healthy.\", \"It\\'s I\\'m not happy.\", \"I can\\'t imagine that she\\'s happy even though she says she is.\", \"It\\'s, you know, we\\'re fighting constantly.\", \"I feel like I\\'m walking on eggshells with her.\", \"She\\'s overprotective.\", \"She just it doesn\\'t feel right.\", \"just doesn\\'t feel right.Ah, that\\'s a huge question.\", \"I just don\\'t I\\'m not sure just this isn\\'t right.Yeah.\", \"I mean, when we started it was it was lovely.\", \"She was amazing.\", \"She was this super caring and thoughtful woman and you know, we are lots of same interests, you know, same friends it\\'s, you know, she was just fantastic.\", \"And I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know where that changed.\", \"And I feel like we did this on again off again stuff and it\\'s just, it just seems like, just not right.\", \"And I know, I know, I don\\'t deserve to be treated this way.\", \"And I know that I\\'m, I\\'m better than that.No, but you know, but she\\'s lovely and I love her and I can\\'t imagine.\", \"I can\\'t imagine my life without her in it.YeahNo.\", \"I think it\\'s  not good for either one of us.I don\\'t know.\", \"I mean, it feels.\", \"I just can\\'t imagine my life without her in it.\", \"So the idea of not having her there feels really scary.\", \"And the idea of staying the way it is, and things not changing, feels even scarier.\", \"So I don\\'t I don\\'t know how to and I don\\'t even know how I would do that.\", \"Our lives are so intertwined.\", \"I mean, my business, our friends, the queer community is so small, you know, that\\'s my family as much as my friends and my family as well.\", \"And so just, you know, how do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way For me, like, in a way that I feel, I\\'m doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself.I don\\'t I don\\'t even know.\", \"I mean, talk to my friend Jay about it and I don\\'t know he suggested like a break, but I don\\'t I don\\'t know.\", \"I just don\\'t want to get caught in that on again off again before like, you know, like we\\'ve done before and, but the idea of a break.\", \"feels a little less.\", \"I don\\'t know, maybe more gentle.\", \"I don\\'t know,I don\\'t know how to give us both time to really think about it and and I don\\'t know, maybe maybe she\\'ll change maybe maybe if I\\'m you know, if this is it, if this is it, like if this break is it, maybe Maybe she\\'ll be able to change.It\\'s just I feel exhausted.\", \"I feel like I\\'m not.\", \"I\\'m not who I was.\", \"When I came into this relationship.\", \"I feel like I\\'m constantly struggling to make her happy, and that just doesn\\'t work.\", \"There\\'s nothing I can do.\", \"And I feel like I\\'ve lost my joy.\", \"And I don\\'t know.\", \"I\\'m just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place where I feel like I\\'m falling apart.\", \"Hmm, my piece.\", \"Yeah.Well, it seems like I mean, if it could happen if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about, like, what I want and what I need and, and, you know, I feel like I can\\'t sort out what\\'s me in this anymore.\", \"And, and so like if I have that space, just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and Taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while.\", \"I don\\'t know, it seems like that would be helpful.Yeah.oh six So somewhat motivated.Because I need I need it.\", \"I feel like I\\'m losing myself.\", \"So I feel likeYeah.Cuz I\\'m not sure how to make it happen.\", \"Yeah, I don\\'t I don\\'t know.YeahExactly.I don\\'t know maybe like a three or four.Because I, I\\'m on it.\", \"I mean, I do something I want.Yeah, yeah.\", \"I can\\'t control her.\", \"I don\\'t know how she would react and I just don\\'t want any more arguments and anger.\", \"And yeah, I don\\'t want to hurt her.\", \"So.it creates a lot of anxiety for me.I think I like maybe a plan, like just knowing, knowing what the rules are sort of like where, where I want to go with it.\", \"And when I\\'m home, I don\\'t know what I want to accomplish.Yeah, regard.\", \"I think an eightYeah.because I know if I just let it drag out that I\\'m going to be miserable.That\\'s, you know, scary.\", \"Change is hard and thinking about not being the woman I thought I was gonna marry that makes me sad.sort of giving up on a dream.yeah, Yeah.That\\'d be great.Yeah.\", \"Thank you.I\\'m doing well Maria.Well, I\\'ve really just been feeling kind of anxious every time I go to work.I work just an insurance company, sort of an admin assistant.Well, I\\'ve started a little over a year ago.Yeah, I would say when I\\'ve started new jobs or even in new academic environments, I would feel somewhat anxious.\", \"Soum, well, it starts you know, when I wake up in the morning and get ready to go to work, even when I\\'m driving in, I just start to get anxious.\", \"And then once I\\'m there, I really just, you know, I go to work and I do what I\\'m supposed to do, but I try to keep to myself.\", \"You know, I don\\'t really enjoy interacting with some of my co workers andum, I guess I just, I haven\\'t really connected with any of them and I, I tend to worry about whether I\\'m doing my job right or if they like me, things like that.\", \"So it\\'s just easier to stick to my my own office.I guess you could say that.You mean how I\\'m feeling or what type of situations that happens in?Okay, um, I guess whenever I\\'m in a big crowd, purchase with a bunch of coworkers.\", \"If we have meetings or they ask for my input on input on something, I tend to get nervous and I just wonder, you know, if I\\'m saying the right thing, and then that sort of makes me get nervous around them.\", \"And then when I start to feel nervous, I get some stomach pains.\", \"I really would prefer just to stop talking, stop the meeting.\", \"And then I get, you know, a little red and blush, as well, whenever we have meetings.Oh, yeah, all the time.\", \"Um, I try not to because I don\\'t want to do a bad job and I don\\'t, you know, I don\\'t want to perform poorly.\", \"But sometimes the anxiety just takes over a little bit, and I just would prefer to go back to my office and be by myself.Why would say I\\'m, you know, when I drive into work, you know, like it\\'s I feel anxious every day and I\\'ve really just been thinking about leaving my job and finding something else where I can potentially even be more secluded and not have to go to meetings frequently or make presentations or anything like that.I was saying, Yeah, I would say so.\", \"Anything where a lot of people are looking at me more than a few, I guess you could say.um, well, sometimes my palms will get sweaty, my face will get red or I\\'ll get overheated.\", \"But mostly it\\'s just some stomach pains leading up to you know, throughout the day, like if I\\'m thinking about what I have to do, that makes me anxious I\\'ll start to get some stomach pains.I\\'m not always worried about it happening again.\", \"I mean, sometimes I can anticipate it happening.\", \"And I would like to avoid it.\", \"But I would say here and there, I would worry about getting the stomach pains or blushing in front of people, things like that, but it\\'s not every time.Well, it\\'s a pretty small company, but I would say probably anywhere between five and 10.\", \"Most of them are above me though.\", \"their positions are above me So,About once or twice a week regularly, and then sometimes we might meet more than that if something needs to be addressed.Mm hmm.\", \"And then some happen weekly.\", \"Okay.Oh, yeah, definitely.\", \"I mean, I think about it, as soon as I know, I always know it\\'s coming.\", \"So I\\'m always thinking about, you know, the next meeting that I\\'ll have to present at or how I\\'ll have to contribute.\", \"And then I just sort of I think about it until it happens, and then it\\'s a cycle.I\\'m not really when I\\'m by myself.\", \"I don\\'t really feel anxious.yeah, like if I have off work for a couple of days, I don\\'t feel anxious at all.\", \"It\\'s really just when I\\'m going to work when I know that I\\'m going to have to be talking to a lot of people or making presentations, things like that.Well, I mean, unplanned meetings, I, I don\\'t really have a lot of time to think about them happening.\", \"But I would say even when I\\'m put on the spot and have to present anything or just even having a long discussion where a lot of people are looking at me or you know, listening to me for a long period of time, I would still say I get pretty anxious about that as well.Yes.Okay, great.\", \"Thank you.Good, thanks.\", \"How are you?\", \"Yeah, I moved into my apartment about a year ago.\", \"And I\\'ve been having, I guess, like, anxious thoughts and sometimes I I\\'m scared I\\'m gonna lose my apartment.Um, well, when I ran out my For the rent,I usually would pay it online but then I would click the button and it would submit it a couple times.\", \"So after I just wanted to make sure about paidso then I started to actually go in person and pay itbut then I check my statement just to make sure the cashier and they got to make And I\\'m also nervous that you know, something might happen where I leave my straightener on and the apartment, like burns down or something.I\\'ll check it and I\\'ll just make sure that it\\'s unplugged.\", \"And, and then I look around and make sure everything\\'s unplugged, because I don\\'t want anything getting caught.Like the toaster and my computer with my laptop charger?\", \"And my cell phone, the charger for that.\", \"And just anything that\\'s plugged in like television.\", \"I just want to make sure everything\\'s unplugged before I leaveI check to make sure they\\'re still unplugged.\", \"But then when I need to use it, I plug it back in.before I leaveYeah.I guess, like six months agoyeah.It started with just thinking about things, thinking about leaving, you know, the door unlocked or being unsure if I paid bills, just like thinking about it.\", \"And then I would have to like double check and triple check.\", \"And just kind of make sureYeah, it started with just thinking and making sure the door is locked.Yeah, I just make sure it\\'s locked.Yeah, I just go in.\", \"I look in a niche where it\\'s locked.\", \"And then I\\'ll go back down and I\\'ll just sit back down and I\\'ll be okay.Sometimes, not really not really.\", \"I\\'ll just check in.\", \"It\\'s fine.Um, I haven\\'t really thought about it, but I made sure everything\\'s okay.\", \"I know what needs to be.Exactly.Yeah, I\\'ll check it.\", \"And then if I\\'m sitting in my car, I just might go back just to double check and just make sure.I mean, it\\'s time consuming.\", \"Sometimes I\\'m late for work, because I\\'ll think I left something plugged in and I have to go back inside.\", \"Sometimes I\\'ll lock the door and have to go back and make sure it\\'s locked.\", \"So I\\'m usually late for things because I\\'m double checking.Um, I guess it would be like,thinking about it.Yeah.is modern look a little higher?Yeah.I\\'m kind of consider myself an anxious person.\", \"So I guess.Yeah.Yes.Yes.Yeah.I\\'m just like group settings or I refer to something when I was younger.\", \"I was like just playing with the door or something like that.\", \"And my parents took me to some doctor.\", \"And they just said I was anxious.They give me a treatment.\", \"Idon\\'t know.\", \"I don\\'t think so they just said I was anxious.No, not really.just feeling anxious, but not necessarily like a diagnosisYeah.NoneJust to like get my tonsils taken out, But not like anything elseNoThank you.Well, I\\'m working full time.\", \"I\\'m part time student.\", \"I\\'ve just gotten engaged, and I live at home.\", \"There\\'s just so much stress in my life, everything happening all at once.\", \"Just to top it all off I failed an exam, a really big exam.\", \"And I just feel like I can\\'t do anything anymore.\", \"I can\\'t do anything, right.\",

with everything and I\\'m living at home so my parents You know, a lot of pressure need to do everything right.\", \"And, and by failing this, I feel like I\\'ve just embarrassed them and disappointed them and I just don\\'t feel like I\\'m good enough to go on Studying.They haven\\'t said much.\", \"I was really scared to tell them actually because I knew they just be so disappointed and

and successful in all those things which are attempted.Yeah.\", \"Possibly number eight.\", \"That loss should be entirely pleasant ending And enjoyable that any frustration discomfortable pain would be unbearable.Umm probabily number 4.\", \"Yeah.That I need to be successful all the time andeverything that I do.Yeah.Well, failing that exam I mean, I wasn\\'t successful with that.\", \"So yeah, it

to do it.\", \"Like I\\'ve already in my head, I know that it\\'s going to end badly.right.\", \"So there\\'s no sense in getting up there.\", \"And maybe if I don\\'t get up there, you know, I guess it couldn\\'t be any worse.\", \"So I might as well just leaveYeah, I don\\'t want I figure if I leave and people won\\'t, will just make me think I was sick or whatever.\", \"And it\\'ll be a better situation, if I just left then happened to see me up there, you know, sweating and all these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up there, it would be better just to leave before that starts.Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody, you know,Right.right.\", \"And I\\'m looking at the clock and saying, you know, like, how much more time in this presentation before I have to go like, should I go?\", \"Should I not go?\", \"What are the consequences of running out?\", \"You know, and kind of playing out, which would be worse?Um, once I

what\\'s going to happen.\", \"And then you know, I\\'m starting to speak.\", \"And then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so.\", \"Okay, so I have to stay up there for the duration and I\\'m just like, you know, sweating and then I\\'m wondering like, are people looking at me or people?\", \"Can people see it?\", \"You know, am I going to forget something?right.\", \"Or they think I\\'ve been lazy and I didn\\'t prepare, are they going to think that, you know, I\\'m dumb or I don\\'t know, you know what I\\'m doing.Right.\", \"Or like be judging me.\", \"Okay.Um, it\\'s depends
